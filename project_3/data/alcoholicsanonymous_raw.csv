The only thing that matters is that he is an alcoholic who has found a key to sobriety.  These legacies of suffering and of recovery are easily passed among alcoholics, one to the other.  This is our gift from God, and its bestowal upon others like us is the one aim that today animates A.A.'s all around the globe.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 151

The strength of Alcoholics Anonymous lies in the desire of each member and of each group around the world to share with other alcoholics their suffering and the steps taken to gain, and maintain, recovery.  By keeping a conscious contact with my Higher Power, I make sure that I always nurture my desire to help other alcoholics, thus insuring the continuity of the wonderful fraternity of Alcoholics Anonymous.

My wife and I are looking at having kids in the next 6 months or so, but I’m really concerned about her relationship with alcohol. I’ve “walked in on” her in the kitchen a few times, just super drunk out of nowhere. Like, glassy eyes, swaying for balance, can’t get coherent words out drunk. Which in itself is annoying, but not a total deal breaker since there’s a lot about her that I love really deeply. But still, I find her unattractive when she’s in that state. 

What worries me is when I’ll ask her about it, she’ll say she didn’t drink anything. Also, I never actually see her drink, so I’m pretty sure she’s hiding it. Which isn’t a good sign. 

Still, the evidence is there. All the once-full bottles in the liquor cabinet are empty, and I haven’t been drinking anything over the last few months. Plus, there are some half empty fifths in the garage that I don’t remember getting. So clearly someone in the house is drinking, and it’s not me. Just the two of us live here. 

So I think she’s drinking in secret, and drinking a lot at times. Still, it’s not a daily occurrence. 

Where I worry is that she totally denies this, and denies the idea that she might have a problem drinking (I’ve learned not to bring this up), and she is totally confident she won’t drink during pregnancy or with small children around. But I’ve learned I can’t believe anything she says or promises about her drinking. So I don’t know what to do here. 

Basically, I’m worried I’ll end up watching my wife hurt herself and our future child with her drinking, but at that point it will be too late to avoid this scenario. I don’t know how to discuss it with her. Since we’re both 30 I feel like there’s a little bit of a ticking clock here in terms of addressing her drinking and starting a family. But ultimately, I would rather have kids safely without her than with her if she doesn’t/won’t acknowledge this issue. 

She has a lot of trauma from her mom’s drinking when she was a kid (dad’s a recovering alcoholic too but hasn’t drank in 28 years). She HATES the idea of therapy and says, “that’s not how I process things.” But she gets weirdly emotional when talking about family stuff so I feel like she hasn’t so much “processed” as “repressed” these issues. I think she has some self-worth/self-love issues around this, that aren’t getting better with age. 

As I understand it, direct confrontation isn’t the way to deal with alcoholism because the sense of shame just leads to more drinking. So really any advice on any of this would be good.

Hello, I (23M) am an addict. I went to my first 12 step- program today and am very glad I did. It was an AA meeting at the university I am currently attending, and although I am not an alcoholic the leader of the program said it was okay if I attended the meetings. (I abuse marijuana and wax concentrate)

I am planning on reaching out to the leader of the meeting and asking him to help me with making a commitment to my sobriety. After the meeting he told me that the best thing I can do for sobriety is ask God to help me. The problem is that I do not necessarily believe in God. 

They told me that all religions can do AA and the 12 step program, even an atheist. The problem is I am not an atheist. I believe it is very possible God is real. I just have no interest in God or prayer... Even if I were to consciously admit that God is real I genuinely do not have anything to say to him. 

The way I see it putting my faith in God is pointless and naive. It doesn't matter if God is real because he isn't here now and he isn't going to protect me from anything. I know this because I have seen life at the bottom.. not personally but I have read and seen so many horrific things at this point that I refuse to believe God has a plan for us. There are so many people who don't really get to live out that narrative: people born with terrible malformations and diseases, little girls kidnapped and kept as sex slaves, Saudi warchild born to drug addicted homeless parents, etc.. Some people are born with zero hope or chance for anything but misery or suffering. The idea that nothing is hopeless and that there is some great plan is nothing but a complete lie. Humanity has conjured mythology to cope with and live in denial in face of the unbearable and awful reality actually is sometimes. Some people don't get chances, and there is no amount of prayer that will bring them salvation.

I think that the belief in God is one of humanities greatest mistakes. As long as we believe God will solve our problems then there is no motivation for us to become desperate to save ourselves from REAL tragedy horror, not some theoretical afterlife. 

That being said, my greater power is community. I am stupid, naive, hopeless, and ignorant- and so is mostly everybody else. However the community of my people is immeasurably greater in value and smarter than myself. When I am lost, arrogant, and useless, I can count on the community of my people that has upheld for thousands of generations and contains wisdom and elders I can seek guidance from. To me that is real, authentic, and effective. I do not think I will ever start praying until I am on my deathbed or in a foxhole, and even though I admit that would probably happen in such case I feel as if praying now would be lying to myself and I cannot honestly admit to the group or my mentor that I have sought out God because I rejected God already and have chosen a different higher power as the object of my 12 step program.

I guess I am just trying to figure out how I can get all of this across to a guy that thinks God is responsible for literally every event in the universe?... Without just telling him I think he is absurd and wrong?

TLDR;

----------------------------------------------------- **now my question is:**
How do you break up with an alcoholic who doesn't want help and doesn't want to stop? How do you do it in a kind, loving and tolerant way? How do I explain my sobriety comes first? How do you say my goals and desires are different? 

A little background: 5 year relationship, we partied together he (34M) works and pays most of the rent but he drinks and doesn't want help. He has 3 DUIs. He is verbally abusive and it gets a lot worse when he drinks (it can get physical sometimes too). I'm (30f) no angel... like I'm an alcoholic too, but I've been participating in AA. I have a sponsor and I've been trying to change my life (currently on step 4).

Any advice welcomed. I just want to hear different perspectives while I try to figure out what God wants me to do.

Now, I can't say I was an alcoholic, and my drinking habits were in the healthy range.

But my liver started hurting after a day of drinking (I don't exceed 3 drinks per day and each drink is 12 fl oz of beer, also, I have a 7-day in-between rule)  So I said that enough is enough. I'm going to stop forever starting with a 90 to really destroy the habit. 

But now doubts are creeping in my mind: ""Hey ... what if I drank right now, and completed the 90-day challenge with me cheating only once. After the 90 day challenge, I promise I'll drink just once a month.""

Maybe I haven't felt enough pain ... but I feel like it's not so bad if I only drink once a month.

Now, if you ever quit alcohol, don't ever come back. This isn't me trying to suggest anything. I had a pretty bad happening with alcohol a few years ago, but aside from that, I've just drunk with moderation.

This is just me asking your opinion on my approach. I know I have sufficient willpower to pull the 30-day rule, but I'm not sure. I was so happy at the thought that I will never drink again, but I don't think that thought is realistic for me.

When I was new, on my very second day of sobriety, a particular group at a particular meeting was going out to eat for fellowship afterward. I had raised my hand for a sponsor and a few remembered I had gotten my 24 hour chip at another meeting the day before, so lots of them stopped to talk to me afterwards and told me I should definitely go. It was very friendly and kind and I was willing to do anything in the beginning so I went.

Being there was a different story. A few talked to me for a moment at the beginning, but that conversation quickly fizzled out and everyone naturally segregated into their own smaller groups of their pre-existing friends. I tried chiming in a few more times but struggled to actually get into a conversation of any length. This one bit** right next to me said ONE WORD every time I talked to her until I gave up. Hate her til this day. They all just talked about people/ things that they knew and I didn’t. I tried my best to stay open and calm (as opposed to socially anxious) and I did not take out my phone. Overall, I did not like this experience. 

I don’t claim to be some amazing conversationalist, so I’m not saying it’s even all their fault. But I felt stupid for agreeing to go to fellowship when no one really wanted to talk to me, even when I was a raw 48 hours sober. And forget about now that I’m 2 months and not new anymore. I WOULD absolutely go to fellowship with my home group, or if a friend I knew was already there. But the whole “definitely go!!!” thing is bullshit.

Without unity, the heart of A.A. would cease to beat...

Without unity I would be unable to recover in A.A. on a daily basis.  By practicing unity within my group, with other A.A. members and at all levels of this great Fellowship, I receive a pronounced feeling of knowing that I am a part of a miracle that was divinely inspired.  The ability of Bill W. and Dr. Bob, working together and passing it on to other members, tells me that to give it away is to keep it.  Unity is oneness and yet the whole Fellowship is for all of us.

Is it okay to eat foods cooked with alcohol if the flavor of the dish is not affected at all? From my research, it seems that in a blind baked crust like this, there would only be 1/4 tsp alcohol left in the entire pie at the end of the process, at most.

Unfortunately, however, I’m struggling to find a sponsor who’ll just go through the steps with me as they appear in the book. I understand the importance of meetings and I’m not particularly averse to them. I am averse to the quantity that’s being pushed onto me. I’m shy, I find them draining, and I know in my heart that 90 in 90 would wear me down to the point that I’d be in real danger of drinking. It has happened before. I can tell when I’ve been to too many meetings because I get thrown off kilter and my mental state goes west.

The thing is, I don’t know where to meet a potential sponsor but at a meeting. And everyone I encounter seems to be of the “meeting makers make it” school, which just isn’t true and definitely isn’t appropriate for me. I’ve read the book, and nowhere in it does it say anything about inhaling meetings.

I’m ready to turn this shit over to God. I want to do the steps. I strongly believe in the idea of one alcoholic talking to another, but everyone I talk to keeps pushing this over complicated narrative that’s not part of the program and it’s honestly just confusing the hell out of me.

I know I don’t have to take these suggestions about going to meetings, but I think I’d find it difficult to work with a sponsor whose only solution to any given problem is to go to an absurd number of meetings and call an absurd number of people who will give the same advice.

Just to be clear, I’m not going to stop going to meetings. Meetings are good, and I’m not opposed to meetings as a suggestion, just the suggestion of literally hundreds as a magical cure-all. Also, power to those for whom 90 in 90 works. I’m just not interested in it.

I’m sorry that this was very long winded, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have to offer on how to find a sponsor who’d appreciate this, or even just how to sensitively lay down to a meeting pusher that I want to do it how the book says without the additional stuff that I don’t find necessary or helpful.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,38821,public,self,Sticking to the Program in the Book,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/qe9qq6/sticking_to_the_program_in_the_book/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

'Shoemaker, stick to thy last!'... better do one thing supremely well than many badly.  That is the central theme of this Tradition [Five].  Around it our Society gathers in unity.  The very life of our Fellowship requires the preservation of this principle.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 150

The survival of A.A. depends upon unity.  What would happen if a group decided to become an employment agency, a treatment center or a social service agency?  Too much specialization leads to no specialization, to frittering of efforts and, finally, to decline.  I have the qualifications to share my sufferings and my way of recovery with the newcomer.  Conformity to A.A.'s primary purpose ensures the safety of the wonderful gift of sobriety, so my responsibility is enormous.  The life of millions of alcoholics is closely tied to my competence in 'carrying the message to the still-suffering alcoholic.'

Cheated on but feel like I'm forced to stay even though I still love her. Made to feel like I was going crazy when it was all happening. I'd point something out we'd talk about it. That would turn into a majer argument and it would end with me being the ahole. Feel like I'm forced because she says if I leave she's going to kill her self. Now she says that if I leave then she won't leave the house. That she has to stay for the kids and accuses me of not loving them because I want to break up the family. I really can't talk to anyone because she got on me about talking to friends and family about my issue when I found out she was cheating. I was basically trying to get help from close ones but she made me feel bad because they shouldn't know our personal business. Also when I've talked to her she has come back and said I complain to much, I'm only trying to make people feel bad for me and that I'm just having a pity party. So now I kinda refuse to talk to anyone about anything. 

Manipulated by my mom now that I look back at my childhood. Well I think it's manipulation, she said she would kill herself if I ever acted like my brother and dad. Witch mainly ment if I was mean to her since that's how she said they would treat her. 

May or may not have been touched as a child. I feel like it's just a nightmare now when I think about it. I'm confused if it actually ever really happened. 

I have never really drank as much as I do now. Did drugs, smoked weed and drank at a young age but it's never got this bad till after the pandemic. 

I know, well think, those could be some causes but feel like people have gone through worse and never went this route. My mental state isn't really all that good but for the reasons listed above I don't really have the will power to talk to anyone. Now that I'm writing this I'm kinda scared my wife will look through my phone and see the post. Then make me feel like an ahole because I told reddit this then go on about how she ruined my life. That's what usually happens. I kinda see it as manipulation but when I brought that up to her, of course, she made me feel bad. I can't remember how because, of course,  i was drunk. Even though I was drunk, i do remember the feeling of it being my fault. This is kind of a rant at this point but it feels good to get it off my chest.

 For anyone who's wondering, I drink 4-6 drinks a day. Witch are 8% alcohol because I can get a buzz faster.

Again, for anyone who's wondering,  the cheating happened about 6 years ago. Since then though, she texted my best friend about things that shouldn't have been talked about between my bf and wife. She proceeded to lie about it till I got some of the truth from him. That happened 3 years after she cheated. Then recently she texted a friend of mine that I told her I didn't want her texting privately. I had accuses to her messanger and would go and read there convos. Fucked up yeah I know. Anyway, I asked her not to privately text him. Just so happen to find out they were texting and yeah it wasn't just friend talk either. That's about the 6 year mark witch happenedabout 2 months ago. So kinda seems like a trend.

I don’t know if what I’m doing is straight up alcoholic; on the road there to, or normal consumption.

I’ve heard and seen what alcoholism can do to one’s life, and I want to avoid drifting down that lane.

Finally, we begin to see that all people, including ourselves, are to some extent emotionally ill as well as frequently wrong, and then we approach true tolerance and see what real love for our fellows actually means.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 92

The thought occurred to me that all people are emotionally ill to some extent.  How could we not be?  Who among us is spiritually perfect?  Who among us is physically perfect?  How could any of us be emotionally perfect?  Therefore, what else are we to do but bear with one another and treat each other as we would be treated in similar circumstances?  That is what love really is.

The exact quote was ""wow, your malipulative"". And its got me doing some deep reflecting on it, and I am not sure the word she used fits correctly.  So I am looking for added perspective to fully recongize this defect of character and work on it.   


Here is the full story.   


On Monday, I had planned to head up to clean the club( prior to the meeting) that we have AA meetings at. I post on Facebook when I do so, so those who wish to stop in can and that there is someone there if they should need them. (I care little about my Anonymity ) One member of the fellowship called me and asked if I could pick him up and he would help me clean. Now this was a voicemail and I at first was only going to pick him up because it was the right thing to do, not that I wanted to. Then I realized that if I picked him up, he would get tired after a few minutes of cleaning make an excuse, then leave and then he wouldn't attend the meeting. So then I became happy to pick him up and did so.   


Now, I pick him and he immediate remembers some errand he needs to run and I drop him off at the errand and he says he will meet me at the club when he is done to help. I get to the club and I clean. He gets there right when I have two things left to do, vacuum and santizing chairs. I ask him to vacuum since I wanted to make sure the chairs were santized correctly. He vacuums for a few minutes breaks the vaccum, then starts another cleaning activity. Then after the cleaning activity which was only a few minutes, he states he needs to go and I run him home. 

I get back and the 1st person for the meeting his arrived while I was gone. I tell her the rundown of what started as me explaining where I was(It was still pre meeting, but during the given time for fellowship) but turn a little into a venting session. Me, explaining running this person to the errand, then him breaking the vaccum, and making the excuse to leave. Then me saying how I knew he was going to do that when I picked him up. 

After that I got the response that I am malipulative. Which of course I was defensive about at first, but a little confused, since I did nothing to change the outcome I am not sure if Malipulative fits. I certainly have an defect here as I should never me happy that someone isn't attending a meeting I am chairing.  I have at least identified why I didn't want this person at the meeting. This person has mental illness that makes it hard for him understand inappropiate behavior and there is some boundry issues with him and women. Which Mondays meeting is majority women, I feel like I have to be on guard when he is there to make sure his behavior is in check, so he isn't making any of the ladies uncomfortable.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,38759,public,self,Looking for perspective on a Defect,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/qcs8rq/looking_for_perspective_on_a_defect/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

We will want the good that is in us all, even in the worst of us, to flower and to grow.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 10

With the self-discipline and insight gained from practicing Step Ten, I begin to know the gratifications of sobriety - not as mere abstinence from alcohol, but as recovery in every department of my life.  I renew hope, regenerate faith, and regain the dignity of self-respect.  I discover the word 'and' in the phrase 'and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.'  Reassured that I am no longer always wrong, I learn to accept myself as I am, with a new sense of the miracles of sobriety and serenity.

Obviously, the dilemma of the wanderer from faith is that of profound confusion.  He thinks himself lost to the comfort of any conviction at all.  He cannot attain in even a small degree the assurance of the believer, the agnostic, or the atheist.  He is the bewildered one.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 28

The concept of God was one that I struggled with during my early years of sobriety.  The images that came to me, conjured from my past, were heavy with fear, rejection and condemnation.  Then I heard my friend Ed's image of a Higher Power: As a boy he had been allowed a litter of puppies, provided that he assume responsibility for their care.  Each morning he would find the unavoidable 'byproducts' of the puppies on the kitchen floor.  Despite frustration, Ed said he couldn't get angry because 'that's the nature of puppies.'  Ed felt that God viewed our defects and shortcomings with a similar understanding and warmth.  I've often found solace from my personal confusion in Ed's calming concept of God.

I took my seat and got to have my sponsor on my right and my best friend on my left.

We had newcomers tonight and I was incredibly nervous about giving them a really good, first time experience.  In the parking lot meeting after, I got to hear that they felt really welcomed.

AA is full of religious (not spiritual) zealots who want to ""take control of your life"".  The only thing a sponsor is for is going through the steps.  AA literature suggests strongly that sponsors let sponsees go back to the groups (ie: leave them alone after working the steps).

As a side note for new people, be very careful in AA.  Todays AA meetings are mostly street drug users.  ""Cousins to alcoholics"" as our literature states, but ""we should not be telling them they are members of AA"".  Criminal behavior comes with the street drug life, it takes a hell of a lot to get off most drugs than it does booze, so the bigshot AA'ers telling drug addicts their in the right place are killing addicts and killing AA.

Pick your meetings, vet your friends in AA.  Our groups in the last 5 years have had everything from ""members"" robbing members, a bunch of sexual assaults on new women, one shooting in the parking lot (dead) and assorted felonies and misdemeanors.

To all you spiritual people who will trash my comments, you would know about this stuff because the AA Grapevine (official magazine of AA) is finally printing stories about this problem, but there were less than 5,000 subscriptions to the Grapevine back in 2015, so most people will never see these.

Anyone tries to take over your life in AA, or pressure you into anything, tell them to take a hike.  AA published a yellow card for meetings in 2019, on criminal behavior, but most groups won't read it, it hits too close to home.  The reason for the warning card is AA New York has been named in a bunch of lawsuits mostly by women assaulted by other members.  This is not a new story, it goes back to Mr Wilson example in sobriety.

There a a lot of alternative today too, there may be a ""last house on the block"", but AA isn't it. Working on fourth decade, I've seen it all, and you were warned.

In the last two years my girlfriend encouraged me to stop drinking and made me understand that I might have a problem, and I started to reduce the amount of days a week that I was drinking until I reached 3 days a week.

Yet after sometime I just returned drinking as I used (only this time 6 days a week and not 7).

Half a year ago I stopped for a bit but I didn’t think it’s a big deal my consumption amount so I went at it again.

The last couple of months I started to wake up every day with the fear of ruining my health and that soon I’ll do non reversal damage to myself, but at the end of each day I felt like it’s still not the time for me to stop, and that I’ll do it in the future.

And then 14 days ago I bought myself 5 beers(half a liter each) planning to have a night drinking with myself, but then my friends went out and I joined them, I had 3 beers with them and went home and drank the entire 5 beers I bought earlier.

The morning after I felt like shit, and the realization that continuing this way will soon lead me to ruin my health if I didn’t do it by now.

It was Thursday morning that I decided to stop cold turkey, I told doctor about it and she sent me to do blood tests a few days later, and it seems I’m ok and I haven’t reached that point yet.

It’s now 192 hours since I did the blood tests and even though I’m ok I didn’t went back in to drinking because, well the anxiety I had about the damages I might have done to myself are very hard to forget and moreover, I don’t want to risk my health.

The withdrawal symptoms and the struggle I had to overcome in these days are obviously another story and this post is long enough by now so I will not expand about it.

I’m here because I really need an advice I got engaged two days ago, and all of my friends want to go out with me and celebrate, my parents wants me to come and raise a toast with them, I haven’t told anyone in my workplace that I got engaged because I’m afraid they will also want to go out and celebrate which means me drinking.

This pressure is really hard on me, I know for sure I cannot attend to all of this events, but to go out with my friend and celebrate is something that I want so much.

I’m considering to go out with them to celebrate and to drink in that single
occasion, but I’m really afraid that it will open the door for my old ways.

on one side I don’t see the harm in drinking with them once, which leads me to think maybe I can occasionally drink only when I go out? 

Like I’m really new at this and I don’t have anyone to talk with, the people around me know I drink a lot but since I’m only drinking beer and only after 10pm they don’t consider me alcohol abuser.

Today I think I am grieving something new... What my relationship used to be like with my parents. Our relationship is changing as I go through the program. I don't want to participate in negative talk and gossip about others. I want to be positive and ask God to take away my defects (step 7 is where I am at). I noticed the last time I spent time with my parents my mom snapped at me for something very small. Just your regular run of the mill passive aggressive, manipulative behavior. I found it hard not to go back to old responses... Stand up for myself. My dad tried talking to me about something I didn't want to gossip about. My response was, ""I don't care"". I felt bad. I was beating myself up and feeling down about my response to my father. That it wasn't positive and I didn't participate in his shit talk...

I shouldn't feel bad because I don't want them to control me or make me feel like I'm bad mouthing everything. I just feel like I'm having to say goodbye to something and it feels like a loss. Like I'm grieving. I think that is what I am feeling. I want to figure this feeling out; not feel bad about it nor feel guilty. I feel guilt used to be my go to.

I’m not very close with my extended family. This mainly stems from a point of being abused by a cousin for an extended time when I temporarily lived with my grandparents. I didn’t feel like my aunts cared about me or wanted to protect me. This has spawned some resentment as an adult and I honestly can’t stand to be around them or any of my cousins for that matter. 

My grandma’s health started rapidly declining about a year ago. According to my mom, my aunts cancelled her life insurance policy and they’ve been mismanaging her funds while she’s been hospitalized for the last year. Essentially there really is no money to bury her and my mom has been trying to save as much as she can now so that she can at least have a decent funeral. 

My mom is a very emotionally needy person and this has really thrown her over the edge. I currently live with her and I honestly have been no help at all. I’ve been sober for about four months now but for the last six weeks I’ve been spiraling through this very deep depression. I do the bare minimum to be functional most days which is just to make it to work and survive  the work day. That’s it. I haven’t really been able to step up and be more responsible with helping out like I was during my grandfather’s last days and i feel bad about it but I was drinking a lot then and stuffing my feelings which I’m not doing now. 

To make a long story short: my mom wants me to travel with her out of state to visit my grandma and assist with possibly getting her established in hospice. There is really no one else she can ask to help her and I just feel like emotionally I can’t do it. I can’t be supportive to her. I can’t be strong now. Not drinking and trying to get a foothold in my 12 step program has felt hard enough. I’m not sure what to do and every time she talks about the situation I get so overwhelmed.

When lockdown started like others I started drinking more, it got to the point I was drinking every night and weekly was drinking about 3litres of vodka. 
I kept putting it down to ‘uni experience’, but I genuinely cannot refuse a drink and every time I try to stop it’s like an urge telling me that just one won’t hurt. I live at home and mostly drink at night when everyone else is in bed, I’m usually myself during the day because of covid so if I have a hangover or want to have a day drink it’s easy for me to do so, but it’s always at night when I feel a real urge.
I go out every week with my friends, I think my body is getting tired of drinking as I was sick twice which has never happened to me before, the next day I nearly passed out and yet I still drank. The following day I was sick 3 times in 3 hours, I decided to come off drink for the week. Last night I struggled not to drink, I ended up just going to sleep but tonight I caved and had 3 drinks, I had water and food after but I actually feel vile- like I’m going to be sick. 
As I said, I drink every night, I always start before 12am, and usually stop whatever time I feel tired at. The amount of drinks range from about 3-10ish maybe, I noticed none of my classmates drink as much as I do and I’m starting to get concerned. 
I did notice that my drinking was starting to get out of hand, but again I put it down to uni experience which I now don’t think that’s the case. The earliest I’ve had a drink is 11am, before an exam about April time, it was tequila, I drank vodka for the rest of the day, but that’s about the only time I’ve did something like that.  
I used to paint all the time, I loved it so much but I stopped because I was drinking so much during lockdown, I was drunk every night. 
I want to cut back drinking, but when I try I really struggle to, I try to distract myself but I keep thinking about how much better it would be if I had a drink whilst doing it. I’m really embarrassed and don’t want to speak to anyone I know about this which is why I’m asking peoples opinions on here.

I used to be a tank maybe 18-28, over time I can't nearly drink as much and I got super sensitive. I figured it out, but still drank often. I'm the ""frat boy"" of my friend group, everyone associates me with a great time, the guy who forces everyone to do shots.

I never used to get hangovers, I used to be a completely high functioning alcoholic.

About a year ago I started getting rapid heart rate, anxiety, things I've never experienced before in and out of drinking. Prior to last year I never had a panic attack ever. Starting March of 2020 I drank very heavily because of lockdown, we made every night a drinking night, sometimes at much as 4-5 mixed drinks (doubles, maybe triples sometimes or if it was wine it was a bottle.

My heart rate was so insane at some points I thought I was having a cardiac event, I remember driving myself to the ER and it was 150bpm while I was just sitting in my car at a stoplight.

Eventually I realized alcohol played a huge role in this, I slowly started to cut back and even took as much as 4-5 weeks off completely. I started to deal with regular panic attacks, depersonalization, and weird head changes....

After adjusting my supplements, getting some blood work done and optimizing I feel just fine most of the time, probably 95%. My blood work shows no liver enzyme issues, but I know those dont check for things like pancreas issues, kidney, etc.

Now... here's the tricky part. If I want to have a couple of drinks, I feel normal while drinking just like I always did, but the next 2-3 days after are half-way-hell... anxiety &amp; panic even if its just like 3 beers, the next day or 3 are terrible.

The question: is this some sort of reaction because I've drank so heavily I've damaged an organ and now this is my body's response, I'm wondering if someone has dealt with this type of issue? Am I fine without alcohol but I'm dealing with AWS (alcohol withdraw symptom) when I drink each time?

Sometimes I have slightly elevated heart rate but I have high blood pressure so 85-90 is not abnormal necessarily. But again if I dont drink for 3-4 days, I'm not dealing with any anxiety, any depersonalization or otherwise.

I can't imagine what else would cause me to have severe adverse reactions the day (or 2-3) after drinking.

I don’t have friends and family, honestly lack of support especially with having an organization abuse me (which I’m suing for the financial abuse; they abused my disability funds which I got back,) lead to me drinking. I’m realizing I can’t do it alone.

I binge drank last night and the night before. Someone told me they consider me a “best friend”and I got triggered cause my best friend is dead, also the fact I have severe insomnia and performance anxiety around sleep, and my previous roommates traumatized me so it’s hard to let people know when they’re noisy but my roommate depriving me of sleep by slamming the door everyday at 5 through 6 am was giving me severe anxiety around bed time about falling to sleep, (it looks like she’s finally stopped doing that, but it took a long time for her to stop,) that contributed to a binge drink. I really want to quit for good and now I know I can’t do it alone. I’m scared of people due to th abuse. So I started drinking to self medicate myself. I rationalized I was just doing it temporarily and could stop ag any time but clearly I can’t and now I’m scared for my health.

Aside from quitting, is there anything I can do to improve my health?

I stayed sober for 2 years, but then went back to it, just not as hard, wine coolers (hate the taste of beer). At about 28 I turned back to hard booze, mainly vodka. I'd buy 1.75 liters and go through it in 3 days, 2 days off, then back to it. I somehow managed to make it like that until I lost my job. Had to quit, which I did, cold turkey, somehow, had klonopin.   


After a year, I went back, got bored with life, back to vodka, same as before. Moved on to wine, because it was less hard, and managed that every night for a year. Finally got caught by my family, was forced to quit again, I managed it, not sure how, it was really rough the first 4 days. Once you got caught tho, the cravings seem to go away. Like you don't want to let people down.... I started back up at 39, to get off the alcohol, I turned to a drug called Tianeptine. I was on it for a year, no drinking, at that was the worse withdrawal I've ever had.... but it worked to stop my drinking. The next year, after experiencing such horrible withdrawal, I was sober.... but since the end of August, I've been constantly back on vodka. It has been 2 months, 1.75 liters every 4 days, one day, feel like crap, then back on it. I'm scared I've gone too hard this time and if I try to quit, I'm going to get the DT's. I do have depression and anxiety, and after 24 hours of not drinking, my anxiety is through the roof and my mind races with horrible thoughts.   


I can't afford to go to rehab, as I now can barely work after f'n up again. I'm afraid if I stop cold turkey, I will die.... but I know if I keep drinking, I will die. What is my best option? My friends and family have lost all hope in me after so many times failing. My liver function was somehow OK after my blood test in July. I need a way out of this. I need some advice. I'm determined to quit, but after 24 hours, I'm just such a mess, I have to drink something. I know that is just an excuse, but I'm scared to death about having a seizure and suffering the DTs.

Defeated, and knowing it, I arrived at the doors of A.A., alone and afraid of the unknown.  A power outside of myself had picked me up off my bed, guided me to the phone book, then to the bus stop, and through the doors of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Once inside A.A. I experienced a sense of being loved and accepted, something I had not felt since early childhood.  May I never lose the sense of wonder I experienced on that first evening with A.A., the greatest event of my entire life.

I've been thinking about it back and forth for about 6 months. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, but I'm also starting to believe that my way of thinking is an excuse as I won't have to deal with it that way. 

My story is as most people these days, trauma etc. I'm not sure though if that's why I'm drinking so much. As a 20 year old I could finish a bottle of wine during breakfast. I used to laugh at myself, thinking that I was ""cosplaying"" an alcoholic. It was silly and I felt in total control. It was a choice that I rarely made. So, rationally, I never thought about it as alcoholism. 

Life moved on, I'm close to 35 today. It started just before the pandemic. I took a glas of red wine every evening. I read an article that it was good for the heart and I thought that it'd be nice to enjoy some wine on my own. I told people at work that it was supposed to be good for the heart and several people asked me if I was an alcoholic. I was pretty upset as I thought that one glas of wine every evening shouldn't be considered anywhere near alcoholism. 

Anyway, covid landed like a bomb in the world and things changed. I started working from home, day one. It all started for me with zoom-parties with friends. We thought it'd be good fun to get drunk on zoom, play games and just enjoy each others company while getting drunk. In truth, I believe we all wanted an excuse to get drunk, and it felt more ""okay"" while talking to each other, pretending we had a party. Thing is though, I believe my friends stopped drinking after the call ended. They probably put the bottle back on the shelf, and went on with their lives. Me, on the other hand, continued. I drank until there was no more to consume. I never considered this alcoholism, just good fun. But - in time I drank more. It started with a glas of wine while cooking dinner. I looked forward to it all day. After a while It got so hard to wait until dinner that I grabbed wine just before I had to start with dinner, usually got so blackout drunk that I skipped dinner. And a while after that I grabbed it while woking my last hour. A while after that I grabbed a glas of wine during 2'o clock break. And then during lunch. And then just before lunch. And finally, I grabbed a beer instead of milk as my drink of choice during breakfast. 

So that's my backstory. Yesterday I spent my savings on alcohol. I couldn't take it being sober on a monday... because, mondays. I promised a friend to meet up in a few days to watch a movie, we talked about grabbing some wine before the movie. I can't afford the wine in a bar, so I'll probably get drunk just before I meet with her. I don't know why I can't watch the movie sober, I just feel that it's impossible. 

My relationship with alcohol has gotten so very intense. And I think it's showing even though no one dares to talk to me about it out loud. I've had friends mention alcoholism, as something they've come in contact with as a relative, friend or a colleague to an alcoholic. I can't help but think that they're trying to talk to me about it. Why else mention it? It's rarely been in context to whatever else we've been talking about. I've had my family talk to me about relatives that been alcoholics (which I never even knew until a few months ago), so it obviously runs in the family, though far back in history. It's as if everyone sees it but me. This has left me wondering, and thinking a lot about it. Are my habits the habits of an alcoholic? Or am I just a normal person who lost my footing for a while during the pandemic?

Even though I know exactly what I did 4 days ago that got me to this point. And I know what happened two weeks before that and a week before that.

I replaced drinking heavily with weed and food and sometimes even just happy joyful moments with friends. But lately the stressors have started to pick up the pace and so again has my drinking. The time between huge fuck ups has decreased and the magnitude of the fuck ups has increased at such an astonishingly fast rate. 

And yet I walked into the meeting today feeling like a fraud….like I’m just being dramatic and want attention and that’s why I was in that meeting. I couldn’t say I was an alcoholic out loud. I think that there is a chance I might not be an alcoholic because I don’t drink every day. I still have a great job and a car and a good credit score.

Its my Day10. Its 4am here, wide awake, excited to start new day.

I start to have clarity in my mind and I feel very positive, very happy. I have relapsed numerous times, mostly due to going too fast and being too hyped (or anxiety), or just attending a wedding/funeral saying I can handle. 

Well I can not handle, not even a drop. So my goal is full sobriety today, for the rest of my life every day.

I have always seen AA something which will not work for me. But this time I am willing to try everything. And also, I met a sponsor through this channel. Promised to think about AA somewhere around day12 when I sober up and think straight... time has come for that...

I would love to hear your experiences about virtual AA meetings. If I join, I would like it best if there are people around the world. I have always travelled, so this is something I could really find also motivating apart from AA 12 steps.

Hope some of you have experience and can share these...

I make no promises to actually go, but I am seriously now looking into it...

I kept going anyway and read a meditation on being in relationship to cure negativity. I decided to lean the fuck in. I found a new live meeting with guys. They were having a camping trip in 2 weekends and I just said yes. 

I was actually dreading it on the way up but when I got there it was great. They were all really cool guys that I would hang out with even if I didn’t meet them in the rooms. It was an amazing weekend and I feel like I made a ton of new friends. 

My program feels rejuvenated and I’m excited about my possibilities for sobriety again.

I guess I'm asking myself the question, is it actually alcoholism. I always thought it was a lack of maturity, some lingering adolescence. Maybe I still do think that. Yesterday I went too far again, drank too much and wound up my father in law at the dinner table. Repercussions aside, something about yesterday was a step too far for me too. I knew I shouldn't have, but I did it anyway, with family around. I admit that I don't have enough control.

My alcoholic thinking led me to believe that I could control my drinking, but I couldn't.  When I came to A.A., I realized that God was speaking to me through my group.  My mind was open just enough to know that I needed His help.  A real, honest acceptance of A.A. took more time, but with it came humility.  I know how insane I was, and I am extremely grateful to have my sanity restored to me and to be a sober alcoholic.  The new, sober me is a much better person than I ever could have been without A.A.

Thank you for your replies. 

4 months ago Mom visited, saw me taper and go thru hell at home detoxing. 


Sober 100+ days. Asked her to promise not to drink when she comes to visit. She said yes. Then I can tell she's drinking here. She has extra anxiety provoking energy in day. And bubbly at night. 

I thought I could handle it and didn't say anything. Well it was too much and I drank, got psyical addicted and tapered and sober day 3 or 4 today. 

Asked her to apologize for brining booze in house breaking her promise. She won't. Says I should take responsibility for my drinking. Wrll yes I do, it's my fault, I took the first drink. But knowing there was booze in the house and dealing with the up n downs of her energy added alot of pressure and I drank. I own a biz, have 2 kids and wife, and alot of stressor. 

I don't think me taking responsibility for my drinking has anything to do whatsoever on her breaking her promise. I believe whole heartedly it was a huge trigger for me. Not an excuse, me and my gal know we can't drink. I would have never had mom visit If I knew she was drinking here. Even if she was sneaking it and not coming out of her room, I can feel it. I have empathic qualities and I am so so sensitive to my environment and actively make it the best I can to help me stay sober. 

I mean, my gal and I did our first ever sober 4 night vacay at the beach while mom watched our kids at home. We didn't drink and had such a good time. Neither of us knew if we could do the trip sober, but moment by moment we did. 

A promise is a promise. I wouldn't do herion in my room if I was visiting a hermon addict, if they asked me not to. I would keep my promise or not visit if I knew it was a deal breaker for the person I was visiting. Especially if I saw them shake and sweat and have crippling anxiety going thru withdrawals. 

Well mom and her sister, my aunt, don't believe their is anything to apologize for. Presumably because my drinking is on me. But I am careful as heck about my life choices and situations to give me the best possible chances to stay sober. 

She feels no remorse, just points finger back at me. I'm not saying I 100 drank because her and uts her fault, I am saying I know my triggers and limits and made my boundaries clear before letting her visit. 

I would love just some thoughts from anyone. Maybe I am wrong about everything. I could be of course. 

Like if she just quit smoking and she said I can't visit her if I smoke on the trip and I agree. Then I visit and smoke in my room anyway. Just seems like ya, I would be wrong to break my promise and feel some remorse and small responsibility for her relapse. Because if I didn't do that, she wouldn't of been around me smoking and smelling like smoke and sneaking off to smoke while we both know what I'm doing without saying it.

And FINALLY, really working the steps. Wasn't ready until I was ready and now I'm ready. Some of us get to be in the 'sometimes slowly' category. The important thing is that it works - especially when you work it. It's not like I've been sitting around doing nothing while not drinking. Been doing lots of other practices - breathwork, meditation, yoga, sauna, cold water immersion, intense daily journaling, connecting with what I now consider my higher power - and during Covid I had the luxury of being able to spend almost all of last year in the woods/fishing/camping/exploring all the local places that are normally overrun with tourists (Alaska). Oh, and being of service chairing/hosting a weekly online Zoom meeting with my wife (20 years in the program). All of which set me up mentally/emotionally/spiritually, to now do the work of the steps for real. Which was good because when I caught Covid last month, it hit me hard (grateful for the vaccine - suspect I'd have died otherwise), and I came out of it with the worst depression I've had in years. I wallowed until my - much wiser - wife suggested I go back to basics and work the first three steps. Got myself a brand-new-old-school sponsor, and I've been working the program harder than anything I've worked at before. Not just half-stepping and playing lip service to it, but committing to it completely. Hey, got news for you folks that are on the fence - IT WORKS! After writing about 20 pages in step 4 (didn't know I had that much resentment!), I've started step 5 and looking forward to the rest of it. Have had just a hint of a taste of the comprehension of the word serenity, and I've even had a few precious moments of genuine peace.

So yeah, I got sober 6 years ago. Life was pretty sucky. Life was miserable. I had a ready made family that loved me, and supported me.  I had everything I ever wanted. A loyal and great woman, 2 daughters and a son. I had everything but the nice car, house, picket fence, and dog. But still drugs were all I gave a shit about. I mean, I cared and loved my family, sure.  But I loved the feelings drugs produced more. Then one day, drugs stopped producing those feelings that I loved. And suddenly, I could no longer deal with the world and the chaos I created. I knew how to be clean but didn’t know how to be sober. Didn’t know how to live life on life’s terms. My fix was no longer fixing a goddamn thing, in fact my fix was making things exponentially worse.  It’s a tricky spot to be in when you’re sick of living but too scared to die.  Suicide was contemplated, attempted, and failed. 

That day I failed for the last time and gave in to the notion that I had a problem, needed help, wanted help, and would succeed or die trying to get better. 6 years later I’m recovered. I have my off days sure, anxiety, depression, commitment problems, disdain for authority, still love starting chaos, saying things when I should bite my tongue, saying things incorrectly without regards to others feelings, posting shitty memes, and starting facebook dumpster fires. I’m not perfect. But now a days, I don’t really enjoy being the center of attention, I actually get anxious over it (no one who remembers the old me would ever believe that!).  Nowadays, I do have the nice car, the house, the picket fence, 2 cats and a dog!! It’s wild to me. 

Today was a huge day for me and my son. But in typical selfish me form, I’m concentrating on why it was so huge to me…Since little Pete was born I always wanted to take him to a NFL football game. And do all that cool shit you see other Dads doing with their kids on TV and in Movies. ALWAYS. But it always seemed like a pipe dream to me during my days of active addiction. Then I got clean and in my mind I made mental notes, a check list of sorts, of things I wanted to accomplish or at least try to accomplish.  I’ve checked off a TON. And today was another one of them. Today was super special to me and I hope to my son too. We were gifted an opportunity from a random stranger to make this memory. And after the game on our drive home there was a homeless guy asking for money…me and Pete gave him a few bucks. I asked Pete if he knew why? He said “You do good things so you get good things in return”. And I smiled and said “Yes and no, dude.  We’re supposed to pay it forward and do good things without expectation of anything in return.  We had a blast today because someone did something nice for us and didn’t want anything in return, so we pay it forward like Lindsey Kozecke would always tell us to do”. Pete looked at me and said “Ahhh I got ya, but he did want you to do something in return…he wanted you to take that video with him and send him pictures.”  I smiled and was like “Damn, touché” the kid is wise beyond his years, because even though we say we do good things for others without any expectation of anything in return and try to practice altruism…ultimately it is for some self-serving purpose no matter how minute it may be. For me, my self-serving purpose is to continue to be blessed enough to make these kind of memories with my family. Best part about being sober is there is no “set” check list, it’s all tentative…we just keep adding to the list day by day. Thanks Lindsey, miss ya.

But he has ALWAYS been able to hold his liquor. I (26) was never aware of any issues growing up. My parents divorced when I was 12 and my dad lives on my grandparents property in a studio style cottage.

My grandpa (dads side) is addicted to any pain relief he can get his hands on. Primarily pills and pain patches, but alcohol will do if he can’t get his hands on his meds. He has been like that his entire life. His brother (my dads uncle) struggled with addiction as well. I’ve never seen my dad take so much as an Advil. So I thought he escaped the genetic predisposition. 

Both my grandparents have health problems. My grandma more so is declining RAPIDLY and my dad is their primary caretaker since he lives there. It’s depressing to watch and exhausting to deal with. She’s on oxygen right now and it’s really an ordeal to take her anywhere because she’s weak and can barely walk on her own let alone carry her oxygen.  Shes still working full time because my grandpa spent every penny they ever made. So they can’t afford to go into assisted living or have an aide come to the house. Nor do they “want” an aide. 

 I have begun noticing my dad is drinking a lot more. He was never visibly drunk when I was a kid, but now when I see him and he is drinking, he slurs some words or speaks a lot slower because he’s making sure he doesn’t slur. He uses excessive hand movements when storytelling. It’s just all too obvious that he’s wasted. I’ve also noticed he has shaky hands even when I know he’s not drinking. I used to wonder if it was Parkinson’s. But now I think it’s from not drinking. 

My father, who is a very strong willed man, has opened up on a few occasions about the immense pressure he’s under taking care of my grandparents. He’s working full time, but coming home to make sure they’re cared for. His only peace of the day is when he’s asleep. Work is his escape from his responsibilities. But work is it’s own pressure. 

As far as I’m aware, he does not drink and go to work. But he drinks at night when he comes home. 

I’m worried, and I don’t know what to do about it. It’s unlikely to stop while my grandparents are alive. I don’t even know what to say. I either tell him I’m worried and put MORE on his plate, or I say nothing and watch him drink.  Or I tell him I’m worried and expect him to stop drinking and just live with the pressure closing in on him?

I got into a relationship recently, and it’s illuminated a lot of defects I’ve been able to avoid by remaining single. It’s become even clearer to me how important completing my amends is, and how important it is to let go of my own will and have patience. 

I don’t think I’d want to date somebody who’s also a sober alcoholic. I like the fact that I’m dating a “fun” girl, and I’ve never felt any degree of insecurity over being sober in a social situation. But this relationship has really challenged me. I am finding myself having a tougher time than ever feeling comfortable in sobriety, and I even picked up smoking again (and quit again, and will smoke the off cigarette and have to go through the quitting process).

I don’t think my girlfriend is an alcoholic, but it’s really hard to say because I have such a distorted view of alcohol and the last thing I want to do is take somebody else’s inventory. 

She seemingly can stop once she starts, but drinks more nights than not and was easily the drunkest person at a gathering she had tonight. It shouldn’t bother me, but it does. All things equal I care about and enjoy her.

*Disclaimer: I made this account just to post here, but I’ve been a Redditor for almost a decade.*

I am newly sober (yay!). I recognized I had a problem, told my wife, and got help. Went through a medical detox (I recommend this for hard core drinkers ready to quit), and now I’m in an Intense Outpatient Program (IOP). I realize that when my treatment program is complete, I’ll need continued support. I have a therapist lined up, and I’ve been to an AA meeting. I am/was planning on AA as a big part of recovery plan.

Here’s my issue and, as a newbie, I hope you guys can give me some direction/guidance. I am a hardcore atheist. I’ve been an atheist activist for many years. I’ve had some conversations about this with my therapist, but not to the extent I’d like. I’ve read chapter 4 of the big book regarding this, and it didn’t give me a truly satisfying answer (besides being a painful read)

Some other points to give further context:

- I am going into this with an open heart and open mind.

- There are definitely elements in AA that I think are very valuable, and I believe can help me maintain my sobriety.

- The AA meeting I attended was very welcoming, but very religious. In their defense, a big part of that was that the topic was the prayer from *According to Bill* regarding step 3.


And some hurdles:

- I’ve been studying philosophy for more than three decades. I know that we can’t generally just choose our beliefs. We’re either convinced or were not.

- I’m not sure what spiritually is. I’ve never heard a coherent definition of spiritual. 

- I’ve talked to folks who say that we can choose anything to be our higher power (someone even suggested a doorknob). If we’re just using things like that (not actual god(s)), aren’t we then really relying on ourselves? Something antithetical to the central tenet of AA?

- I was also told that this higher power had to be all-powerful and has to have the ability to enact the change that I’m not capable of. Is this true? It seems to contradict some of the point in the previous bullet.

Thank you, in advance, for any guidance you can give me. My responses might seem argumentative, or that I’m the very picture of Bill’s (mischaracterization) of what atheism is, but, I’m just being as honest as I can.

I went through a lot of trauma and have had underlying mental health issues since a child. Been alcohol dependant on and off for about ten years,I've had withdrawal seizures 34 to be exact, pancreatitis twice.

My mother is a alcholic and my father a daily binge drinker and I currently live with them, I'm finding the cravings just so impossibly hard to beat!

""Maybe you got a bad batch."" he said.

""No the sauce is the same. I changed. Because I have this illness of alcoholism, my tolerance weakened. Alcoholism doesn't come in bottles, it comes in people.""

""Sounds pretty confusing"" the fellow said

""You think you're confused,"" I said, ""You should have seen me. I drank for happiness and became unhappy... I drank for joy and became miserable... I drank to be outgoing and became self centered... I drank for sociability and became argumentative and lonely."" I drank for sophistication and became rude and obnoxious...I drank for friendship and made enemies... I drank to soften sorrow and wallowed in self pity... I drank for sleep and awakened without rest.

I drank for strength and felt weak.. I drank medicinally and got sick.. I drank because I thought my job called for it and I lost my job.. I drank for relaxation and got the shakes.. I drank for confidence and became uncertain.. I drank for courage and became afraid.. I drank for assurance and became doubtful... I drank to stimulate thought and blacked out... I drank to make conversation and it tied my tongue... I drank for warmth and lost my cool. I drank for coolness and lost my warmth... I drank to feel heaven and came to know hell. I drank to forget and became haunted. I drank for freedom and became a slave...I drank to erase problems and saw them multiply... I drank to cope with life and invited death ..or worse...

A little over a month ago I had posted about how I had engaged in gossip (character assassination), and how I had had to endure the consequences of that. Some people in the fellowship had turned against me. I basically ended up leaving AA as a whole. I quit all my service positions and left my sponsor. 

A few days after leaving, my hands started to get all sweaty and my thoughts started racing the way I used to before I was in the program. I actually got trembling hands. It actually felt as if I was going through alcohol withdrawal. 

I basically  had 2 options: relapse or be a dry drunk, or go back to AA. I live in the relatively small town with a rather small AA fellowship, so it's pretty impossible to go to completely different meetings and never run into those people again. I contacted my old sponsor and she's my sponsor again. I've also resumed my service positions. 

I haven't apart from to my sponsor though, I haven't really made amends yet because the people I had issues with have somehow disappeared.

How do I maintain my spiritual condition?  For me it's quite simple: on a daily basis I ask my Higher Power to grant me the gift of sobriety for that day!  I have talked to many alcoholics who have gone back to drinking and I always ask them: 'Did you pray for sobriety the day you took your first drink?'  Not one of them said yes.  As I practice Step Ten and try to keep my house in order on a daily basis, I have the knowledge that if I ask for a daily reprieve, it will be granted.

God designed us to be exactly who we are. Our self- perceived assets and shortcomings may be hard to grapple with. But what God bestowed us with are God's gifts to us. What we do with these qualities are our gifts back to God. The sooner we can accept and take accountability for the roles we have been given, the more readily we can embrace our journeys. 

I may not like being a sensitive person, but God likes it because it makes me compassionate. I may not see the value in my health problems, but God didn't create me this way for no reason. If I think about my challenges hard enough, I can see how they might be worked into qualities that benefit the world and make me a better person.

The next time you find yourself cursing your bad hair, your stutter, or those extra ten pounds, remember that they're not meaningless. Just like your ability to comfort a grieving friend, ace that biology exam, or bake the best cookies in town aren't, either. 

We struggle to see ourselves through God's lens rather than the world's, but which of these perspectives actually matters? I believe that when we die these confusing conditions will make more sense. But what if we could learn to accept the roles that we've been given before that? How would that change the quality of our lives, and the lives of those around us?

Today I encourage all of us to examine the possible meanings behind our many qualities. How can we use them to make the world a kinder, gentler, more beautiful place?

I got arrested for 4th OWI in February and started going to AA meetings, but in the back of my mind there was always this little doubt telling me I want really an alcoholic and I'm being over dramatic and just want attention or something. I do relate in meetings, and people seem to relate with me when I share but this little seed of doubt has not gone away. 

I ended up relapsing in August after 6 months and struggled to stay sober for a full day all through September. September 28th I got drunk for the last time and started going to meetings again on the 29th. 

I typically drink 5-6 days a week, and I black out about half the time, maybe more, I'm not sure. At this point I mostly drink on my own at home because I'm afraid of blacking out in public, but that doesn't stop the shame and embarrassment I feel the next morning. Not to mention the drunk texts/ phone calls that I don't remember. 

The other day on this sub I made a comment about how ""when I try to control my drinking I can't enjoy it, and when I try to enjoy it I can't control it."" And another user here started telling me that I wasn't an alcoholic and they weren't sure why I wanted to be an alcoholic so badly and that ""my disabilities"" don't make me an alcoholic, and that alcoholics recognize each other and they don't see it with me. 

Other than depression and anxiety I don't have any known disabilities, and I'm just very confused now, mostly because they said things that I've always kind of thought were true, that I'm not actually an alcoholic, and I don't really belong in AA. 

I was feeling pretty good about my Sobriety until that altercation, now all I can think about is getting drunk to ""prove them wrong"" even though they're a stranger on the internet who is now blocked and will never know or care whether they were right or wrong. Basically, I'm just tired of arguing with myself about everything. I thought I was doing the right thing, now I feel like I'm just wasting people's time going to meetings and that I really don't belong there.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

During my early years in A.A. I saw Step Ten as a suggestion that I periodically look at my behavior and reactions.  If there was something wrong, I should admit it; if an apology was necessary, I should give one.  After a few years of sobriety I felt I should undertake a self-examination more frequently.  Not until several more years of sobriety had elapsed did I realize the full meaning of Step Ten, and the word 'continued.'  'Continued' does not mean occasionally, or frequently.  It means throughout each day.

Well, this isn’t a philosophical debate about split words and picking apart the nuance of the book. I must admit I do enjoy that sort of thing. It’s just not what I’m going to be talking about here…. You’re welcome. Instead, this is a sort of fifth step.

I say, “sort of” for two reasons. Primarily because it’s not a first fifth step. I’m one of those guys that upon ‘finishing’ the steps loops back to the start and goes through it again. I do believe and practice my daily maintenance steps, but I also find it rewarding to slowly go back and focus on each step one at a time. 

Unfortunately, I don’t have a sponsor right now, and I just moved so I let myself off the hook and decided not to share the fifth step. After all, the book says this step can be postponed. So I justified my fear with that excuse.

Some may say what I’m sharing here isn’t a fifth step at all. To them, I say, “yup you’re right. I’m probably confused.” Instead what this could be is a portion of our maintenance steps. It’s around steps 10 and 11 where the book suggests we ask ourselves if we have kept anything to ourselves which should be shared with another alcoholic.

The second reason I say this is only sort of a fifth step, is that a fifth step is when I share on the defects revealed by the fourth step. This is only about one defect because it flows from one resentment.

Tonight, I said the seventh step prayer as I thought I was on this step. Trust me I'm sick and tired of this defect. It’s unbearably painful and has caused repeated difficulty in my life. 

However, as I said the prayer I was hit with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I know I haven’t told anyone about this defect. I argued with myself at first, stating I talk about it all the time. Probably too much! People are tired of hearing about it at this point.

Here’s the thing. No matter how badly I would like it to count, complaining about the other person is not the same as revealing my defect. 

So here it is. My great big defect is self seeking.

Yup, I like sticking to the four categories the book lists, but don’t worry I’m not letting myself off that easily. I will elaborate and give specifics.

This term has produced great confusion for me. It sounds so much like selfishness it’s hard for me to conceptualize what it is. I think I get it now, and I think it’s my problem.

It started to make sense when I heard someone say they were seeking self in others. And that, my friends, is a definition I can work with. The instant I heard them say that I related.

It’s absolutely something I do and have done. Its resulted in so much headache and pain in my life. 

When I was 15 I had enough of my Dad. For the purpose of brevity, I’ll keep the jist of that relationship to one sentence: he hurt me badly repeatedly. At 15 I said no and refused to return to his house. 

It was for my emotional well being and I do not regret the decision. It was the right call according to logic and reason.

Emotions, as we all know, don’t often accept reason and logic. Looking back on it I can see that rejecting my Father left me deeply wounded. I wanted so much from him. I wanted his love, approval, and respect. I wanted my Dad to be proud of me, and he simply wasn't.

If I take the book's suggestion to view the other person as sick, well maybe he just wasn’t capable of those things. Or more charitably, he wasn’t capable of displaying those things in a healthy and normal manner.

Regardless, I belive my father was an early example act of self seeking. Don’t get me wrong, I was perfectly normal for feeling those feelings. The self seeking aspect is that I was seeking my self worth in him. 

I’m not anything like a psychologist, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this is a normal thing for a boy to do. How then can such a normal thing be a defect? Well, one answer comes from the 12 and 12: our natural healthy instincts can get out of whack over the course of life. 

Additionally, I don’t believe a defect is all that bad of a thing. That is to say, I don’t view defects as sin. They certainly can be, and frequently present themselves as such, but it’s my understanding that they are simply defects in my character. 

If I were a line of code it would be an error, and my divine developer would like my permission to correct it, so that I may function in line with my true nature. At this point in my program (no pun intended) it doesn’t hurt my feelings (AS MUCH AS IT USED TO) to discover a new defect. 

After the age of father idolization came to an end, I got myself a high school sweetheart. She was my world. I ignored my friends, family, and school work to be with her. I thought I was in love with her. I wasn’t. Real love is something akin to admiring a moth that lands on your porch. You don’t grab it and make it yours forever. 

I did - metaphorically - grab that girl and try and make her mine forever. Self seeking. That searching for myself, my value, in her was not love, but a defect. A defect that made the end of the relationship unbearable.

It was at that time I began seeking comfort in a bottle.

The self seeking didn’t evaporate with the liquor. Instead, it carried on with numerous people. My drug dealer, my next girlfriend, and the girl after that, to name a few.

You might be wondering at this point if I’m confused and actually uncovered codependency. Well, maybe. I don’t think so, but I see where you're coming from because I’m wondering the same thing.

I don’t know that much about codependency, so my analysis is rudimentary at best. That being said, I think codependency is… when you're dependent on another person. Perhaps self seeking, as I interpret it, can rise to a level of dependence.

Yet, at its core, I think self seeking is something you do to yourself. These instances I’m sharing about involve other people, but I don’t think that is a necessity of the defect. When I’m honest, as I can be with myself, I see that this defect also occurred with positions of status.

For example, I was raised Christian and went to a Christian school. I looked for value in my Christianity, and I don’t mean I found my self worth in my faith. I was not about that. I looked for value in the status of being ‘holier' than my Christian peers. It was about the status of it.

I later did the same thing with my position in Boy Scouts - I will be the best Senior Patrol Leader not to help you, but to seek myself in that position of status. Then later as a stoner I let you know how I skipped work and class on April 20th, so I could validate my identity. When I got into shrooms I bragged about ego death - the irony was lost on me - to validate my self perception.

This brings us to the most recent time this defect burnt me. I lost a close friend. I want to tell you all the little petty things he did to me, and gripe and moan about him, but honestly, it doesn’t matter. In reality, he didn’t do anything too bad to me. 

He did some stuff and I did some stuff. We’ve had arguments. We’ve been dicks to each other from time to time. It happens when you’re that close to a person. 

He changed over the years and so did I. We got on each other's nerves more and more frequently because of those changes. I ended up getting a different job and moving. Now we don’t talk.

In the good old days, we had an inside joke about a certain number. It became his number. It seems that every time I look at a page number, the time, my phone’s battery, or a license plate I see the number, and I’m filled with anger. Every petty thing he ever did wrong comes rushing back to my mind.

It’s been months and I’m sick and tired of this resentment. 

The reason it hurts so damn bad is because I was absolutely  seeking myself in him. I remained his close friend for so long, not because I valued his company, but because I had to. After all, who is Burton Guster without Shawn Spencer? Who is Robin without Batman? ^((Nightwing)) Shaggy is just a stoner without scooby-doo.

It wasn’t fair of me to put that burden of self validation on anyone else's shoulders. It’s essentially a lie; a distortion of the truth. Rather than seeing who those people were, I saw who I wanted them to be. I can’t really get to know them if I’m seeing a mirage of who they are. Maybe I knew them well at one point in time, but I can’t watch them grow as a person when I’m, by nature of self seeking, only seeing the aspects of them that validate me.

This self seeking via another person limits my ability to be a good friend because I’m approaching the relationship selfishly. This aspect of the defect doesn’t really apply to institutions and status, but the next portion applies to everything.

Self seeking harms me. It keeps me from seeing the position or person as they really are. It’s the opposite of acceptance and a total lack of self respect. When I look for my value in external places it’s selling myself short. It’s robbing me of truly knowing myself.

I said earlier that I’m sick and tired of this defect. I am, but at the same time, I see why the book tells me to pause and review the other steps before moving on. I need them in order to take step six. In order to truly be willing to have this defect removed, I must be willing to truly experience reality. I must be willing to learn who I am. 

That terrifies this alcoholic.

It's only through using those first three steps can I possibly take the next two.

I’m 29.  I don’t want to drink everyday of my life, I have a job I have a commitment to and never want my drinking to be a hinderance to that. I never go to work hungover, I hate it.

My struggle is that alcoholism runs in my family. My dad was (is? Idk I don’t see him a lot these days) an alcoholic and so was his dad. I reserve weekends to getting drunk, that’s what I look forward to. Only maybe one weekend every three weeks or so am I not in the mood. Most of the time if I have a couple of beers I want to continue until I get drunk and then stop. 

My bf likes to drink as well but his dad is an alcoholic and he doesn’t want to end up like him so I want to limit my drinking for his sake.

So I created a new account and started [posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/g26i1m/celebrating_18_months_just_went_through_my_post/) about my journey. That was around 4.5 years ago. 

Long story short, today I celebrate 3 years since I took a drink and it turns out, in order to stay stopped, I did need AA, I do need AA lol. I spent the first year and a half trying to get sober my way, I would go to AA but also hated it and its culty people trying to tell me what to do. Finally, I was so miserable from relapses, I decided to be full in and get a sponsor and work all the steps. For me, it was the only option I had left, my doctors and therapists couldn't keep me sober. 

Sorry for the click-baity title, but I'm sure a lot of you can relate. This isn't to say that AA is the end all for recovery, or that there aren't other ways to stay sober ( I love r/stopdrinking!). But for me, it's what ended up working as a long term solution, but it took me about 2.5 years to believe that. Sometimes quickly sometimes slowwwwwlllllyyyyy.

I was a heavy whiskey drinker (IMO) 1-2 pints a day, plus seltzers for chasers. While functioning, I was merely in auto pilot. I feared the physical withdrawal the worst and think that’s what kept me from being sober so long. 
I keep waiting for this overwhelming urge to drink and it hasn’t crept up yet, or I’ve fought it well. I cant tell. I think of drinking often only to find it more habit than desire. I quickly remember the raging asshole that comes out when emotion surface while I’m shitfaced, or I hold on to the moments I’ve been  blessed to be present in in the last 20 days, and suddenly the right choice becomes easy to make.

Long story short: I ended up having an inappropriate relationship with two different men in the program who both had significantly more time than me, 5 and 24 years respectively. Three months in I can see it as being a mistake and I feel like managing the emotions I have from these interactions has nearly costs me my sobriety dozens of times. 
At first, it was a big source of shame for me and I kept it a secret from my female friends in the program but eventually after just going through so much emotional turmoil I started to open up to people including my sponsor about what was going on.
I’ve gotten mixed feedback. Often I hear I’ve been a victim even though I initiated both interactions and other times I hear that I should’ve been more focused on my sobriety and taking the suggestion not get involved in a relationship. 
I’m just at the point now where I feel so much anger and confusion. I am soooo uncomfortable around any man at the meetings now because I feel like now I’m constantly questioning their intentions even though most of the people I’ve encountered are really good people who want me to do well.

Both of mine are from Chapter 4, 'We Agnostics'. It's honestly my favorite chapter of the Big Book, however, it didn't always make sense to me. The first time I read it, I didn't actually comprehend what it was saying. And once I had read the chapter once I didn't have to read it again, right? 

So I stayed around for a couple weeks and I had my first spiritual experience. I didn't know that's what it was at the time, but looking back, it definitely was. 

I was leaving my usual meeting and as I got into my car an overwhelming wave of 'everything is going to be ok' washed over me. I felt completely accepted, like my AA hall was where I belonged my entire life. I was alone in my car and the emotions I was feeling were equivalent to my parents giving me a hug and telling me they loved me. 

Later, going through the steps with a sponsor, we get to chapter 4. I read it and get to those two quotes. And everything clicks. I finally know that I don't have to definitively know who or what my higher power is. I just have to know that it is.

Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too.  Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 67

Sometimes I don't realize that I gossiped about someone until the end of the day, when I take an inventory of the day's activities, and then, my gossiping appears like a blemish in my beautiful day.  How could I have said something like that?  Gossip shows its ugly head during a coffee break or lunch with business associates, or I may gossip during the evening, when I'm tired from the day's activities, and feel justified in bolstering my ego at the expense of someone else.  Character defects like gossip sneak into my life when I am not making a constant effort to work the Twelve Steps of recovery.  I need to remind myself that my uniqueness is the blessing of my being, and that applies equally to everyone who crosses my path in life's journey.  Today the only inventory I need to take is my own.  I'll leave judgment of others to the Final Judge - Divine Providence.

I’ve been able to be sober for about 10-11 months twice since I started drinking because I was pregnant with my two beautiful girls. PPD with my oldest didn’t help me at all and I’m not using it as an excuse. Nobody would listen to me. The antidepressants my doctor put me on made it worse. So, I said to hell with it and drank. My oldest was about a month-month and a half old. When I drank I wasn’t angry at everyone (minus my daughter… my PPD never targeted her), myself or the world. It felt like everything just lifted off my shoulders and I finally felt somewhat normal. That should of been a massive red flag but I was so deep in my depression, a whole carnival of red flags could of been right in my face and I wouldn’t of even noticed it. I drank quite a bit before my oldest but after PPD, it got so much worse. 

Due to the PPD it took 6 years before I was finally ready to try for another child. I got pregnant pretty instantly. I’m talking within a month. 🤣 Unfortunately, we lost that one within a month. Two months later, we were gifted our rainbow. Again, sober whole pregnancy. She was a month old when I took that drink. I thought, “Well, I’ll have DH handle the kids and have a chill night and relax.” I look back now and laugh, not with humor but with disgust. It’s never just one night is it? She’ll be five in five months.

I know I need to stop. Went two days without drinking this week which is a big deal for me. Then, last night, my bright self decided to just finish what was left of my little under half 5th of Jim Beam. It takes a lot to get me drunk anymore and I wasn’t drunk. Decent buzz but something happened when I laid down to go to bed. My heart was racing, my brain was going every which direction and I almost started crying because I realized I don’t like that feeling anymore. I felt out of control. I felt out of control with my body, my emotions. This is the first time where I’ve said to myself, “Im done.” Im not even sad. Im not anxious about it and I have horrible anxiety. Im never calm! 

I live in a small town and really don’t want to attend AA meetings here but I can’t drive 45 minutes to the nearest town, either. I don’t care about seeing “Billy” or “Martha” at the grocery store. Im just a private person and I’m embarrassed and ashamed. I just wanted to know if there’s anyway to get a sponsor online and do online AA meetings where I don’t have to show my face. I’m talker and I need someone who understands and I can talk to on the bad days because I know they’re coming.

Just about everything life could throw at me, it did, when I first got sober, and looking back, now, I figure if I could stay sober through that, and I did, I can stay sober through anything, and I will. 

I’ve wrestled with alcohol addiction for about 25 years. Longest I was sober was around four years, or so, and then stress came toppling down and I had begun to believe I would be fine if I began to drink again. 

After four years of being sober, the little drunk inside my head was still as cunning, baffling, and powerful as it had ever been, but I let myself get complacent. 

The little drunk demon inside my head has pulled every trick in the book on me at various times throughout my life, so I have no illusions of what I’m up against. I also know, ultimately, I am in this alone, and sometimes I stay sober just to say “Fuck you” to the universe. You won’t take me today. 

Working toward my 60 day chip, now, and I’ll keep going until I collect them all. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’m grateful to be sober, today. One month, twelve days, one hour, and forty-four minutes, now.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 86

I lacked serenity.  With more to do than seemed possible, I fell further behind, no matter how hard I tried.  Worries about things not done yesterday and fear of tomorrow's deadlines denied me the calm I needed to be effective each day.  Before taking Steps Ten and Eleven, I began to read passages like the one cited above.  I tried to focus on God's will, not my problems, and to trust that He would manage my day.  It worked!  Slowly, but it worked!

Addiction runs in my family and was always told to ‘be careful’ with drugs and alcohol because I am statistically more likely to get hooked. These comments were typically followed by an eye roll. Plot twist, I got hooked. 

I am so ready to be done, and have tried multiple times in the past on my own. I am finally ready to start attending meetings and really putting in the work.

I also don’t want them worrying about me every time someone at the table orders a drink, or if we go to a concert.

Life had gotten hard and I wanted to die. I knew what would make that feeling go away -- a drink. The compulsion came back in a hurry. Half a beer later, and I wanted to quit my job, move to NYC, get whatever work I could, and drink myself to death.

Fortunately, that was just one night and when I sobered up, I realized that I needed to get honest with myself and with this program. See, I'm one of those people that doesn't ever want to be ""the class fuckup"". I was like, if I'm going to be an alcoholic, I'm going to be the best damn alcoholic in AA. I got a sponsor. I did 30 in 30. I worked the steps. I took all kinds of service positions. But, I wasn't being honest with myself and when life got hard, as it does, I picked up a drink.

The second time around, I got a new sponsor. I made a searching and fearless moral inventory. I stopped trying to be a ""good alcoholic"" and got honest with myself and those around me. Part of that was 30 days of raising my hand as a newcomer and then picking up a 30 day chip. That was 22 years ago today.

Since then, both my parents have died. I got married, divorced, and married again. I got laid off, quit jobs, got promoted, got told I ""wasn't meeting expectations"", moved, etc...

Continue to watch for selfishness, dishonesty, resentment, and fear.  When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them.  We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone.  Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The immediate admission of wrong thoughts or actions is a tough task for most human beings, but for recovering alcoholics like me it is difficult because of my propensity toward ego, fear and pride.  The freedom the A.A. program offers me becomes more abundant when, through unremitting inventories of myself, I admit, acknowledge and accept responsibility for my wrong-doing.  It is possible then for me to grow into a deeper and better understanding of humility.  My willingness to admit when the fault is mine facilitates the progression of my growth and helps me to become more understanding and helpful to others.

I recently found out a friend has been going to a bar 2-4 times a week.  I know that alone this may or may not seem to be significant, but how they are going about this is what is concerning and making me think that they’ve developed a problem.  Or at least are heavily relying on alcohol as a crutch for their problems.  

To start, they lie about what they are doing.  They say they are going out with other friends or spending time with their family, but the only thing they have planned is to end up drinking at their bar of choice.  Note - they found out we knew this was going on so they started going to a different bar.

When they do this they are 100% alone.  They meet no one, but occasionally bring someone they’ve met home for a hookup.  They literally sit at the bar, order drink after drink, scroll their phone, and then drive home.  

They often leave their house late in the evening (9-10PM) and don’t return home from the bar until after 1AM most nights, unfortunately driving themselves home.  And they have to be at work by 9AM most days. 

They hide what they are doing very well.  Or at least they try.  They are a well established adult in their 30s who is intelligent, has a good but high stress job, and are a very calm person so most people would not know they have a problem.  I know that alcoholism does not discriminate though.

Being honest, I have 0% experience dealing with alcoholism.  I’m guessing most people will not say that any of this is normal?  Does anyone have a similar experience they can share and how they handled it?

I’m not sure what to say or even do.  I want to be a helpful friend but not cross any lines.

When we speak or act hastily or rashly, the ability to be fair-minded and tolerant evaporates on the spot.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 91

Being fair-minded and tolerant is a goal toward which I must work daily.  I ask God, as I understand Him, to help me to be loving and tolerant to my loved ones, and to those with whom I am in close contact.  I ask for guidance to curb my speech when I am agitated, and I take a moment to reflect on the emotional upheaval my words may cause, not only to someone else, but also to myself.  Prayer, meditation and inventories are the key to sound thinking and positive action for me.

He vocalized that he thought our group should rethink closing the meeting with the Lords Prayer. He said that it’s a Christian prayer and has the potential to alienate new comers who might not share that particular faith. I, as a non Christian agree with him 100% although I did not vocalize it at the time. I never recite the Lords Prayer even though my home group closes with it every week. It’s a Catholic prayer and I personally find the Catholic Church to be a corrupt and questionable institution. I wouldn’t  never try and steer someone away from their faith as I believe it is a deeply personal choice. But I agree that AA prayers should be non denominational. The old timer who brought this up was very polite and provided examples of alternatives that are in the big book. The next day I attended another meeting and over heard a group of men saying some pretty vicious things about this guy for merely making a suggestion. A suggestion I quite frankly agree with completely. The guys talking shit are also old timers with lots of sober time under their belts. Guys who I previously looked up too in a lot of ways. I’m torn between feeling like this shouldn’t be such a big deal to me and wanting to speak up about it. I have and always will refuse to recite a Catholic or Christian prayer. I’m fairly certain if I tried to close a meeting with an Islamic or Hindu verse there would be fits thrown. I know this should probably be something I just shrug off but I’ve done a lot of metal gymnastics already as an atheist in AA.

He is a horrible drinker in the sense of you only get coherent him for an hour max, and then all down hill until he passes out. He’s always been this way and it’s always been irritating to drink around him and embarrassing to drink with him around our friends and family. He is not an angry drunk, or mean or anything like that. He’s just the worst version of himself. He says stupid things that he never would sober, he is outrageously flirty and overly nice in a really uncomfortable way, and his body just gives up on him to the point of his running into walls or his legs giving out when he stands and he drops everything! He’s just a dumb drunk. Anyways, we’ve recognized this as an issue throughout our years together and he’s tried to be sober at least 4 times. We are on the fifth time now, maybe. It is very frustrating for me, because I, of course, want him to get sober, but I am struggling with understanding how he can’t just drink without blacking out every time. I get that a few drinks in and all sense is out the window and that’s why, but it’s so difficult for me to put myself in his shoes and I feel so guilty about it. I am a very easy drinker. I love a few glasses a few nights a week, but I’m extremely functioning and can drink for hours without being even remotely close to his level. Of course I’ve had my nights where I have gone too far, but it’s usually a result of something going on and I went into the situation intended to get more wild than usual. I am being sober along side him to be as supportive as I can be, as I always have been. However, I feel like I am being punished for an issue that I don’t have.

Staying sober the first couple of years is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  It took lots of meetings, sometimes 3 a day, a good sponsor, and working the steps.  I also had to cut things out of my life that made me want to drink.  

I am not a an ideal example of how to work the program.  Sometimes I’ve been an example of what not to do.  I’m glad the program allows for imperfection, as long as we are honest and rigorous.

These days, not drinking is my habit.  Cravings, once always present, are almost nonexistent now, and if they do arise, are easy to dismiss.  However, I never want to let my guard down or forget where I came from.  It was a horrible place, and I never want to return.

I say all this to let you know that if you embrace the program with honesty and a willingness to work, not only is sobriety possible, it can get easier the longer you stick with the program.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 91

My drive to work provides me with an opportunity for self-examination.  One day while making this trip, I began to review my progress in sobriety, and was not happy with what I saw.  I hoped that, as the work day progressed, I would forget these troublesome thoughts, but as one disappointment after another kept coming, my discontent only increased, and the pressures within me kept mounting.  I retreated to an isolated table in the lounge, and asked myself how I could make the most of the rest of the day.  In the past, when things went wrong, I instinctively wanted to fight back.  But during the short time I had been trying to live the A.A. program I had learned to step back and take a look at myself.  I recognized that, although I was not the person I wanted to be, I had learned to not react in my old ways.  Those old patterns of behavior only brought sorrow and hurt, to me and to others.  I returned to my work station, determined to make the day a productive one, thanking God for the chance to make progress that day.

I was told to go to meetings, get a sponsor, work the steps, help others, get involved, among other things.

Since coming back to AA God has done marvelous things in my life. If you don't believe in God we can call it ""Me getting out of the way"". My life is full. I am a loving man. I am useful. If your life is dark and you feel hopeless I plead that you really give AA a shot. Not just an AA sub on reddit, or checking out some zoom meetings- get involved. Get a sponsor, set out chairs, help clean up, give people rides to the meeting, call people, chair meetings, get a home group, get plugged in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I alone am not responsible for these changes....my own experience proved that time and time again. This part of the book is one of the first things I read with my sponsor. He told me I had to stop with the belligerence (fighting to stay sick ""yeah, buts...) and demonstrate some willingness (I was taught that willingness is action. I wanted A LOT of things in my life, but what actions did I actually take to get them?)

&amp;#x200B;

My actual sobriety date is Oct 13. I went to a friends wedding on Oct12 knowing full well I was going to drink. But I also knew the end was near. I was circling the drain. I was beaten down. It was the most miserable night of drinking. I drank not because I wanted to, but because I HAD to. There was no choice. I drank full well knowing that I was done, it was a very strange feeling. The next day I went to a meeting and that's when things began to change. Oh how dark it is before the dawn indeed!

**From The Spiritual Experience:**

**Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves is the essence of spiritual experience. Our more religious members call it ""God-consciousness.""**

**Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover, provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual principles. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.**

**We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program. WILLINGNESS, HONESTY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF RECOVERY. BUT THESE ARE INDISPENSABLE.**

I abused psychedelics as a late teen early 20s person. It got bad. I definitely have an addictive element to me. But I also have general life long depression and anxiety and probably some kind of OCD…i do have issues.  

Was I happier when I was 24 in early sobriety living a carefree life in a halfway house surrounded by insane people, constantly socializing? While still half way high from drug use? Sure. That was a like 2006. 

I’m an adult now. All my friends have gotten married, I’m pretty darn isolated, 2020 was very hard on me as I got laid off early pandemic from a real career and didn’t get a real job for about 9 months. I relocated back to my parents and sister’s family area. I have no friends here. 

I thought 2021 would be a big comeback year. Turns out my new job of pretty toxic. I got mono and was really sick from July 3rd through just recently. I’m still freaked out by covid especially after being sick for months and my closest coworker is a covid long hauler and suffering every day. 

And returning ‘home’ as I push 40 years old, single, isolated, I’ve been taking to and seeing my parents a lot. Our relationship has degraded, at times, to points that are very similar to my rough teenage years. Which I totally did not expect. 

They clearly have PTSD from what I put them through. Just being around me so much more and also seeing my increasingly unhappy (sick for months, can’t eat hardly anything, unhappy with work, feel lost) - they are super triggered. They seem to think I’m going to go full alcoholic rapidly or just kill myself or something. This is very much them dredging up feelings from 2005. 

But it’s very confusing to me. I am drinking and smoking pot less now than pretty much any point since I got un sober 10 years ago. My depression level is not crisis level. They just aren’t used to dealing with me regularly and I’m over sharing. 

But they have worked themselves into a nearly panicked state about me and are essentially insisting that I go back to AA if nothing else but for the fellowship. 

I don’t know if I’m very Dry and worse than I realize and they are right, or if this is much more complicated. But if I ignore them I may really damage the relationships so I pretty much have to go to some meetings to try. 

I speak to with a therapist 2x a week and a psychiatrist about quarterly. They see me as not ideal but ok and I just need to do more positive stuff with my life. Though I’m not doing that. I am in a emotional and behavior rut, poor emotional sobriety, but have also just had a really difficult 2 years and lately few months. 

I don’t really think I am an alcoholic but certainty am kind of on the line there. But not actively abusing. And while making friends in AA does sound like it could be a huge help for me, it does not really feel appropriate with that at the top of my agenda, aside from appeasing my parents and sister who have decided this is the solution.

I went to a bunch of different meetings and loved all of them and met a woman at one who invited me to another of her regular meetings. So I went with her but did not like the meeting. It seemed more like a pickup scene to me with everyone very done up and dressed up and what seemed like flirting. I also felt like people were checking me out like people check each other out at a bar or club or party whereas the other meetings I had gone to were very much come-as-you-are, low key, and zero pick-up vibes whatsoever. So that’s my first IS THIS NORMAL question. Was I just in less polished (I don’t know exactly what word to use) kinds of meetings at first or something?

Anyways, someone at the pick-up scene meeting Who knew me very casually saw me and is friends with the woman who invited me there. the pick-up meeting (as I think of it now) is her Home group. I didn’t recognize her because she was dressed up and wearing makeup and had her hair done and I’d never seen her like that before. she invited me to another meeting she goes to so I went with her. 

On the car ride to that meeting she was kind of combative and confrontational about aa and sobriety in general in a way that felt rude and insensitive to me. I’ve been through hell the last few weeks with so many different things and am feeling very beat up already. Her interactions with me left me feeling discouraged and attacked. At the meeting she got upset with another woman and said something pretty sarcastic to her and it made me really uncomfortable. But I still went out to fellowship afterwards with her and enjoyed it except for a few more sarcastic comments that were quite off putting. But I actually found a woman to be my temp sponsor there. That’s my second IS THIS NORMAL for aa question. Are some people just more aggressive about aa and sobriety because they know how serious it is to stay sober? 

Fast forward to today and I asked the first woman I met if she was going to the meeting this week that I met her at originally because I’m planning on going. She said yes and that I should go to fellowship beforehand and I politely declined as I have been running a million miles an hour ever since I got sober almost 3 weeks ago and my treatment counselor has advised me to SLOW DOWN because “recovery isn’t running around like a chicken with your head cut off.” I literally have 3 hours of time before this meeting where I will have to opportunity to sit alone in silence with myself, meditate, rest and chill the fuck out. I can’t remember the last time I’ve done that. She responded telling me I have to go to fellowship because it’s so important in early recovery and asked if It was a money issue? I agree with her on the importance of fellowship and tried to explain how I have not had time to slow down and needed to do that before this meeting and had gone to fellowship after a meeting with the woman we both know and loved it and actually found a sponsor there. She responded with a very short “see you at the meeting”. Wtf? That’s my third  IS THIS NORMAL for aa people question. Now I don’t even want to go to the meeting because I’m afraid she going to try to make me feel bad for not going to the fellowship. 

These two off putting women have been sober for many years so I want to respect them but outside of AA I would nope the hell away from these kinds of people and situations.

Times for me have been rough because I live in the boring state of Kansas, I lost my brother (aged 26), and I am very upset about being circumcised.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 90

What a freedom I felt when this passage was pointed out to me!  Suddenly I saw that I could do something about my anger, I could fix me, instead of trying to fix them.  I believe that there are no exceptions to the axiom.  When I am angry, my anger is always self-centered.  I must keep reminding myself that I am human, that I am doing the best I can, even when that best is sometimes poor.  So I ask God to remove my anger and truly set me free.

All i’m craving right now is a liter of vodka to down tonight but i’m pushing through it (barely). I always try to stay sober but haven’t been able to make it to two weeks in years.

I would drink throughout my work day until I fell asleep at night because for some reason the way alcohol makes me feel is better than anything else can, except working out. It’s like I have to be addicted to something and fitness would be my only other addiction. Alcohol has also made me a very aggressive person, attempting to ruin my relationship now and already has ruined one in the past and has also led to me being fired from a job. I know to some people it may seem easy to stay off because of how much bad alcohol does bad for me in the long run and because i’m so in love with working out and eating clean, but i can’t stop myself. I drink to blackout, to where I won’t remember a single thing, to not remember falling asleep, and it’s embarrassing. i want it all to stop, i want to get back into what i loved.

It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 90

I never truly understood the Tenth Step's spiritual axiom until I had the following experience.  I was sitting in my bedroom, reading into the wee hours, when suddenly I heard my dogs barking in the back yard.  My neighbors frown on this kind of disturbance so, with mixed feelings of anger and shame, as well as fear of my neighbors' disapproval, I immediately called in my dogs.  Several weeks later the exact situation repeated itself but this time, because I was feeling more at peace with myself, I was able to accept the situation - dogs will bark - and I calmly called in the dogs.  Both incidents taught me that when a person experiences nearly identical events and reacts two different ways, then it is not the event which is of prime importance, but the person's spiritual condition.  Feelings come from inside,not from outward circumstances.  When my spiritual condition is positive, I react positively.

So I just wanted to reach out tell my story &amp; offer my services. I do outreach free of charge &amp; help people get into treatment centers all across the US regardless of insurance. I’m just trying to share my story &amp; help people who many be active in addiction, on the fence about what to do with their lives or know someone struggling. You can message me anytime with questions, if you are seeking treatment, treatment for someone else or just want a friend to talk to. I do not charge any money at all. This is just my way of giving back &amp; being altruistic as that is the main thing I try to practice. I welcome anyone to reach out for My email or number. Before you read my story just know you do not need to have an ideal version of God or a higher power or even need to have a faith based program to be in sobriety. Below is my story that I hope will help even just one person.

My name is Alberto I’m a recovering, recovered  heroin addict or whatever terminology you want to use, it does not matter. I’ve been sober since August 13th 2020 &amp; haven’t looked back since. I have had many years on &amp; off in sobriety but this time is when I finally was able to put it all behind me. A little about myself is, since the age of 14 I have struggled with heroin/fentanyl addiction &amp; many other forms of addiction. Heroin was the first substance I ever touched. For nearly 13 years on &amp; off I was heavily in the abyss of addiction &amp; done every single thing in my own way to overcome this disease. 

Of course not a single idea I thought of or plan I conjured up worked. I was a mad scientist trying to bend the rules of addiction to my will but failed each &amp; every time. It was only through acquiring a fellowship, spirituality &amp; finding the similarities that we as addicts/alcoholics share that helped me reach the moment that I know is what people described as when it comes to never wanting to use 
again.

I could talk about all the trauma &amp; pain I went through but none of that matters to me anymore, what matters is what I did with all of that pain. What I did was I was able to mold it with help &amp; was transformed from a victim into a survivor. By really understanding what surrender is, is only when my higher power &amp; others were able to truly help give me the gift of sobriety, but not just sobriety but a life I now cherish. 

Relapsing was more common to me than breathing, if a thought of using came into my head regardless of how much time I had you could bet your life I was going to use. The reason for that is because I never took the time to understand why I use. I would go to meetings, get a sponsor, go through the steps, pray to God &amp; even called people who I thought didn’t care about me but actually did. You never really understand what asking for help is like until you show people your true vulnerability. When I was able to open up to people &amp; God about my pain, trauma &amp; shame amongst the others things we all go through as alcoholics &amp; addicts, is when I was able to understand the difference between being helped &amp; asking for help. 

Being helped means you took the steps regardless of how uncomfortable or how vulnerable you end up. Each layer to my psyche was torn apart, each wall around my heart was broken down, each lie I told was brought to light. It was in these moments with people like yourself reading this that were able to help me understand why I use. I used to escape, I used out of insecurity, I used because I was an empty man with nothing to fill but substances that lasted as quick as they went into me, but with nothing to show for afterwards. After all the work, reaching out &amp; steps I took I was finally able to really feel spiritually fit for the first time. The empty hole in my heart was not filled but mended. It was mended by those regardless of what they went through, how they looked, age, sex or skin all understood the feelings I felt. Ever since I have never felt alone. I was always the kid to be reluctant to give it a shot, my ego was a monster that no man could tame, but God is not a man. 

No matter what you have been through people will always find a reason to help you, you just have to let them. Help is a nice word but the work that it entails is filled with trials &amp; sometimes torment that will bring you to your knees. The only thing that matters is you keep moving forward &amp; persevering. If you ever feel weak do not remember the pain you went through but remember the people who want to help you. Below are some pictures of a pale boy who was lost &amp; almost swallowed up by hell called addiction but now that boy became a man through the help of others who understood what he was going through. I am
Now a man who cherishes life, who yearns to be altruistic &amp; most importantly I smile not to mask emotions I don’t want you to see but because I am generally happy.

I went back at noon yesterday (just a couple hours after my first post) because i felt like i had a lot to unload and was almost frustrated that i didn’t the day before. I showed up, forced myself to get out of the car again, went inside and sat down. They asked if there were any newcomers which was obvious because there was 9 of us in there and the other 8 people all knew eachother, lol. But i raised my hand and and said yes, and proceeded to have my first step meeting. I explained what made me walk in there for the first time and of course balled my eyes out.

Everybody was extremely nice and helpful and i got a lot of phone numbers and information.

Today is three days since I last drank. I have been trying to get out of this hole that i dug for myself with school and work and as a result, my stress levels are very high.

As many of us know there has been a brief history of psychedelic substances involved in the early formative years of AA. 
Here is a quick explanation on the correspondence between Bill W and Carl Jung around the usage of psychedelic drugs and twelve step work. 

 “Some of my AA friends and I have taken the material (LSD) frequently and with much benefit,” Wilson told Jung, adding that the powerful psychedelic drug sparks “a great broadening and deepening and heightening of consciousness.” 

Wilson told Jung that his first LSD trip in 1956 reminded him of a mystical revelation he had after hitting bottom in the 1930s and winding up in a New York City hospital ward for hardcore alcoholics. “My original spontaneous spiritual experience of twenty-five years before was enacted with wonderful splendor and conviction,” he wrote. 

LSD was still legal in 1956, and in Wilson’s case initially taken under the medical supervision of UCLA researcher Sidney Cohen, and with the spiritual guidance of his Wilson’s friend, Gerald Heard, an Anglo-Irish mystic and early proponent of psychedelic spirituality. Wilson would go on to quietly form a bi-coastal psychedelic salon with various leading lights of that decade, including the writer Aldous Huxley.

Wilson’s earlier spiritual experience occurred in December of 1934, before LSD was even invented. It happened during Wilson’s fourth and final stay at a private New York City hospital that employed something called the Towns-Lambert Cure to treat their alcoholic clients. Many of these patients, including Wilson, were once-successful businessmen whose drinking had spun out of control during the Great Depression. 

“Suddenly,” Bill would later recall, “my room blazed with an indescribably white light. I was seized with an ecstasy beyond description.”

That room was in a rehab center where doctors employed a potion which included two drugs derived from plants known to cause delirium and hallucinations. One of them is belladonna and the other henbane, was long associated with witchcraft and potions said to summon the spirits of the dead. (Warning to psychonaunts: both of these plants can be poisonous at high doses.) 


Apparently Carl Jung would come to pass before responding to Bills second letter. 


I would never share this in a meeting format but after 8 years of sobriety I developed a severe autoimmune disease and lost the ability to walk- after a few years of trying various mainstream medical treatments with no real progress I turned to alternative treatment methods. One of which was a shamanic ceremony where I ingested the psychedelic drug Iboga.  Afterwards my symptoms subsided nearly 70%. 
This past year I have been able to manage my chronic Lyme inflammation and mobility symptoms with continued micro-dosing of psychedelic drugs. I take micro amounts of psilocybin mushrooms and iboga root 5 days out of the week. 

It’s helped me tremendously in the realm of autoimmunity but I have largely kept my mouth shut about it in twelve step circles. 

At times I have wondered if I am putting my recovery at risk doing this. The truth is that I feel much better physically and mentally when using these medicines. 
My spiritual life and the conscious contact I have with my higher power feels stronger than ever. 
This sort of thing still automatically raises an alarm in my brain and I find myself thinking “I am using a chemical to control how I feel”
And this raises the natural suspicion if what I’m doing is healthy or not.  

I’m not so much interested in anyone’s personal theoretical opinions - but I’ve wondered if anyone out there in 12 step internet land has any actual experience, strength, or hope around the subject.

I just can’t get over the cult/religious vibe I get there. Everything is so ritualistic and stiff and it seems like everyone’s high on the Bill W Kool-aid. I enjoy hearing people’s strength and hope and I buy into a lot of the philosophy and steps.

I just disagree with some aspects of the program. But it seems like any deviation from full indoctrination makes me a failure before I’ve began as I’m trying to find “an easier, softer way” and you’re considered non committal by members who’ve been around longer and fully bought in.

I like being independent and autonomous and I can’t help but wonder how much personal growth I’m truly experiencing if I’m just shutting my mouth and nodding my head and living life in a way that’s laid out by something outside of myself.

Is there no gray area?

The sentiment that anyone who is sober but not following the program is secretly miserable and deluding themselves is a big red flag to me. But it’s a prevalent opinion when you walk through those doors.

Anyone whose made it another day sober has accomplished a great feat, whether they did it through there own willpower and determination, found support in family or friends, God or through AA.

I don’t think one way is easier or more right than another. But what do I know I’m early in recovery like I said.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59

I was beginning to approach my new life of sobriety with unaccustomed enthusiasm.  New friends were cropping up and some of my battered friendships had begun to be repaired.  Life was exciting, and I even began to enjoy my work, becoming so bold as to issue a report on the lack of proper care for some of our clients.  One day a co-worker informed me that my boss was really sore because a complaint, submitted over his head, had caused him much discomfort at the hands of his superiors.  I knew that my report had created the problem, and began to feel responsible for my boss's difficulty.  In discussing the affair, my co-worker tried to reassure me that an apology was not necessary, but I soon became convinced that I had to do something, regardless of how it might turn out.  When I approached my boss and owned up to my hand in his difficulties, he was surprised.  But unexpected things came out of our encounter, and my boss and I were able to agree to interact more directly and effectively in the future.

I’m making the decision daily to not drink. I still think about it a lot, and suppose I probably always will. But for today, I’m just going to enjoy not feeling run down, or overwhelmed. 

I firmly believe in God, and one verse that stuck out to me is 

Isaiah 5:11 (ESV)
“Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening as wine inflames them!”

So I’m going in my first 74 days of sobriety, I love the aa program and have made some good friends. My first week I started going to aa I had a lady in her 70s come up to me and saw that I was a mess and she offered to be my sponsor. She came up to me and asked if I had one and I said no and she said oh well not anymore, I’m gonna be your sponsor. I thought it was a little strange because I thought we were suppose to ask people but I was grateful that she offered so I can get started on the steps. She was really good, she has 48 years of sobriety and I can tell she knows her stuff, she also has a lot of Sponses. So she gave me a packet to work on and started working the steps. As time went on she would make comments about how being a hair dresser isn’t a “real” career (I’ve been a hair dresser for 10 years now) and gave me tons of shit about smoking a nicotine vape pen as I’m trying to quit smoking cigarettes. I kind blew it off because I know she’s an old timer and just wants what is best for me. But things just started to get worse, if I had to go to a clients hair at their house (I’m just doing it on the side right now because I want to be stable in my recovery before I get a real job) and if I couldn’t make a meeting because of it she said she didn’t want me missing meetings. I currently am going to 4 meetings minimum every week and whenever I miss one I make it up and I’m also in an intense outpatient program on top of that. 
I was suppose to meet at her house a few weeks ago and I was waiting outside her door for almost an hour as she wasn’t answering the door (I confirmed with her the day before) she ended up calling me a few hours later and said she was getting X-rays done at the doctor, I was a little irritated because she didn’t even let me know she was doing that and we confirmed the day before. 
Whenever I talk to her about personal stuff (I’ve had 2 tragic deaths in my life recently and my best friend is currently out using drugs. Also there’s a lot of family drama in my life that I try to stay out of but I’m involved because it is my family) she just tells me it’s none of my business and just to let it go. She also says I need to get over people that died and stuff happens and she’s seen tons of people die and you can’t let it effect you. I understand where she’s coming from as a sponsor but those things are easier said and done. 
I recently went to an nfl football game on Sunday with my boyfriend and his dad. I normally go to a Sunday night meeting but my sponsor doesn’t attend that one. We got stuck in a ton of traffic on the way back from the game and we didn’t get home till late, on the way back she texted me and said she was going to be at that meeting and she’ll see me there. I told her I was stuck in traffic and wouldn’t be going and I had no idea she was even going to go to that meeting. She ignored me and the next day she was upset with me because she said she went to the meeting just for me and didn’t show up. She also questioned why I would even go to a football game during Covid and to never do it again. I explained to her I am vaccinated and I actually had a good time and was proud of myself because it was the first event I’ve gone to sober and didn’t drink. She just kept telling me to not go again. 
I also have been wanting to try an NA meeting that my friends from my out patient group goes too because they are all about my age, but I’m scared to tell her because she thinks alcoholics shouldn’t be going to an NA Meeting and visa versa. 
Long story short, I think I want to change sponsers but I don’t know how to go about it. I feel like if I talk to her about how I feel she’s just gonna get upset because she’s so set in her ways. She is a nice lady but I’m starting to get anxiety whenever I talk to her because I don’t want to say the wrong thing. I don’t want to have to change my home group because of this but but I’m horrible at confrontation. Any advice on how to go about this situation?

Continued to take personal inventory...
- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88

The spiritual axiom referred to in the Tenth Step - 'every time we are disturbed, no matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us' - also tells me that there are no exceptions to it.  No matter how unreasonable others may seem, I am responsible for not reacting negatively.  Regardless of what is happening around me I will always have the prerogative, and the responsibility, of choosing what happens within me.  I am the creator of my own reality.  When I take my daily inventory, I know that I must stop judging others.  If I judge others, I am probably judging myself.  Whoever is upsetting me most is my best teacher.  I have much to learn from him or her, and in my heart, I should thank that person.

I went to my first AA meeting last night. I’m 22 years old and was the youngest person there by a long shot. I was coming off of the worst bender of my life that lasted from last Thursday to this Wednesday morning when i laid on my couch in my apartment for 12 hours in a state of complete withdrawal.

I sat in the back for the whole hour and didn’t say a word. I really wanted to speak up but i was barely holding myself together and i knew that i would start balling my eyes out if i even tried to start talking. I know not sharing at meetings is okay, but i could tell that most of the people there could tell i was a newbie and wanted me to say something, but they weren’t about to make me uncomfortable or anything, which i appreciated.

I’ve always been the person in my friend groups that gets the most fucked up, incoherent, and does some of the worst shit a person can do while fucked up. I’m embarrassed to say that i really can’t remember a single minute of Monday-Tuesday.. I’m a college student in my last semester and i didn’t go to class or work either of those days because for some reason i decided what was best for me was to keep the bender going and i just sat on my couch drinking a fifth of Jaeger.

I come from a long line of good people that are really bad alcoholics, on both sides of my family and i really feel like i have disappointed them tremendously.

This 4-5 day period in which i was fucked up almost nonstop wasn’t the first such occasion that I’ve done that, but i do believe it was the worst and the longest and i don’t ever want to go through the hell of what i did Wednesday morning as well as the shame and embarrassment of my actions for myself and my family.

I don’t really know what else to say at the moment.

I’m 23 years old. I usually have 2 or 3 drinks before bed every night. This isn’t usually enough to make me hungover, but I have tend to drink pretty heavily on the weekends. I get terrible anxiety when I’m hungover. No headaches, just random panic attacks about absolutely nothing.

I drank heavily Wednesday through Sunday last week(which isn’t typical for me). Monday morning I had to pull over 3 separate times during a 45 minute drive due to my anxiety. I haven’t taken a sip of alcohol in 72 hours, but still had panic attacks frequently yesterday/today, and have only gotten about 8 hours of sleep total the past two nights, so I believe these are alcohol withdrawals.

I’ve accepted that I need to slow down on my drinking and have proven to myself the past few days that I’m capable of doing it. My question to you guys is this: Let’s say the withdrawal symptoms are gone on Friday. If I drink on Saturday (not heavily of course), will the withdrawals come right back the next morning, or would I have a clean slate to work with?

When I was a teenager/young adult I had some pretty severe alcohol/drug abuse problems. I never wanted to label myself an addict, but I did eventually get sober after hitting rock bottom. Then I improved my life and got started on a career years later.

I still drank though. It took a lot of practice, but I switched to beer instead of liquor. And most of the time, I was too busy to drink. At most, I would go out binge drinking once a week while in college. And yes, I was disappointed in myself that I still had little self control when going out with friends.

Fast forward to today, I am fresh out of a divorce, have little connection to my family, and it's getting too late for me to ever have my own kids one day. I have a hard time imagining myself in another relationship because I always choose abusive men. So it's really not worth it. And now I have nothing to live for. 

I have been drinking everyday, getting shitfaced every weekend night. I love it when people cancel their plans on me so I can just drink in private instread.

But I had a stern talking too by my friend. Saying I need therapy, and I agreed I would go. But I kind of don't want to. I already know that I will go and they'll tell me to stop drinking. And I don't want to. What then?

I'm an alcoholic who previously had been to a detox center. This has been probably 2-3 years now. Since then, I do okay. I don't know that I'm your typical AA alcoholic, as I managed to get into social drinking in the last year or two and seemed to be relatively okay. After getting out of the detox center, I stayed away for quite sometime, and then found myself occasionally going out and getting plastered. This would happen maybe once every month. Since then, I cleaned that up quite a bit, drink maybe 1-2 times a month (and not much at all). I also go to the gym and practice fitness and healthy eating.

I really thought I had it all turned around.

Last Thursday, I was in a wedding, and I drank with the wedding party and had maybe 6-7. Felt fine but hungover the next day. Friday, I drank at the wedding as well. I really screwed up - I'm certain I had over 16 drinks (spirits) to myself, which implies a 750ml bottle of liquor or more. I also woke up the next morning and drank 3 more, purely for the pain. I haven't drank since, so today is day 4 with no alcohol and no intention of continuing. I didn't eat at all Saturday and Sunday, and have been doing my best with water intake daily since but it's been averaging around 80oz. per day, and I'm 190lbs and usually drink around 120oz. of water. I started going back to the gym on Monday.

This is the second time this has happened this year, and the last time it did, it was only one night, I was hungover for at least 7 days. It is the same this time too, however in looking up symptoms like tingling arms, and just general flu-like symptoms I came across alcoholic neuropathy. Right now, I have a slight tingling in my arms and just some brain fog and some tremors. If I remember right, the only other time this happened this year, it went away after 5-7 days. I did not know about AN at that time, and I'm now afraid I've caused myself an issue and am worried that I should seek medical attention.

In regard to my habits, I had everyone convinced (including myself) that I was no longer a problem. So much for that huh? Luckily, since I got out of detox I have developed a habit of being able to not drink, so as long as I don't attend the wrong events, I won't drink by myself, or at home or anything like that. So moving forward from here won't be difficult, as I typically don't even have cravings or urges. I just wrongly convinced myself that I was able to handle something I'm not, and instead of manifesting itself in daily drinking, it all came out in a 48hr period.

Let me know what you think, I'm really nervous about this.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,38292,public,nsfw,Can a severe night of binge drinking cause alcoholic neuropathy?,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/q2o2eb/can_a_severe_night_of_binge_drinking_cause/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

... and Fear says, 'You dare not look!'

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 49

How often I avoided a task in my drinking days just because it appeared so large!  Is it any wonder, even if I have been sober for some time, that I will act that same way when faced with what appears to be a monumental job, such as a searching and fearless moral inventory of myself?  What I discover after I have arrived at the other side - when my inventory is completed - is that the illusion was greater than the reality.  The fear of facing myself kept me at a standstill and, until I became willing to put pencil to paper, I was arresting my growth based on an intangible.

My husband’s ex-wife is currently going through the steps, and claims that she has completed them and has become a sponsor. However, she never made any effort to make amends to our family, and when asked, she said she was making living amends because she didn’t have to make direct amends if it would hurt somebody, and it would hurt her. 

In all the research I did, it said direct amends are best unless it hurts the person you’re making amends to. It would not hurt us at all, she knows it, and we were looking forward to finally having an honest conversation with her. She definitely knows that amends are needed at the very least to the kids that she abandoned due to her addiction. 

Am I just completely misunderstanding what it means to make amends? I thought an apology is supposed to “hurt” the person making it, that’s the entire point of admitting you did something wrong and you feel sorry for it.

I am 43 and would consider myself a functioning binge drinker since the age of 15.. My love for alcohol for me and my friends started in high school and continues to this day. I am not a daily drinker but a binge drinker every week from thurs to sat and then I am sober from sun to thurs.. This is process that has been on repeat for almost 30 yrs.. As I mentioned,  I consider myself functioning because 1) I have held a job since the day i left high school, moved up within the industry and continue to be successful, 2) feel I am a good father to the two children I have and 3) have a solid marriage w/ a wife that is my best friend .. I have always been a happy drunk but I am a blackout drunk..I mostly drink alone but I also rely on it heavily in social settings. I have dealt with anxiety for yrs which I always thought was relieved by my drinking however I understand that my vicious cycle is the culprit of the anxiety/depression.. About 1 yr ago I decided to sober up for a while just because (not call it quits, that was never the intention).. It lasted a surprising 75 days and then I celebrated with drinking.. I then adjusted my cycle to drinking once every 2 weeks foe a bit but it wasnt long before I was back to my usual 3 days on 4 days off binge (15 to 20 beers a night) cycle. This is what i became to know and love..Recovering Sum to Wed and back at it come Thurs (it cant come soon enough)

What I know is that 75 days was the best I  have ever felt in my life.. During that 75 days, I was exceeding expectations at work, being a more ""present"" father and husband to my wife and kids.. Anxiety and depression had vanished.. Looking back I should have kept going. 

I recently told my wife that I'm going to make another run at drying out with the goal in mind to beat my 75 days. Today is day 24 and I already feel so much anxiety relief and clarity. Even though I said I was going to dry up with a goal of &gt; 75 days, I since internally decided I am going for permanent sobriety. It doesn't make any sense to go back to my repetitive unhealthy lifestyle.. I feel I have a second chance at life to figure out who I really am and what I can be without the sauce in my life.

Since starting this life altering journey I have visited this sub daily and I find it helpful to keep on path.. Thank you all for listening.

I had 2 DWI’s by the time I was 22. Rehab like 3x, court cases 2x, probation, the works. During most of that, not a bone in my body wanted to quit drinking beers.

From Early 2018-Summer 2020 I had 900ish days alcohol free, the last 250-400  or so of those days were drug fueled pure insanity. A girl I grew up with died in a terror attack in Sri Lanka, a few other neighborhood kids died, my best friend died of an overdose, then another girl from school, same thing a month or so later. 

I had already given up caring while not drinking, pre meditated relapse, textbook. At first I hit as many meetings as possible, was riding a pink cloud, it felt great. Then I pretty much figured I was better than anyone else who struggled with drinking, and nobody could school me. 

The end result was seas of rage and insanity honestly worse than any hangover or guilt related to drinking or really anything. It was the worst most uncomfortable irritating daily feeling I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy.

Throughout my drinking this year I feared more legal trouble, and tried several times to clean up to no avail. A week here and there, a month tops. More recently came within hairs of catching an assault after a blackout bar brawl I have 0 recollection of. 

I don’t want to say “by the grace of god” ‘cause the only certain thing I know about God is it’s just the word Dog spelled backwards. 
But by the grace of god, someone looked out for me and no charges were pressed.

I knew it was time to go back to AA. As much as it sucks balls throwing in the towel, admitting as a man I need help, and not being able to go party *the bars suck these days anyway, 0 females out on weekends (all at home watching tv due to covid)

I'm 20, part of me feels like it's pathetic that at 20 years old I'm already one year sober. That at so young I had a problem and had to choose sobriety if I wanted to survive. In September of 2020 I got black out drunk and fought cops, that was my rock bottom. I knew something had to change. From the second I turned 18 to that point at 19 I was essentially drunk every night. If I couldn't hide the night drinking I'd day drink and walk around. I functioned. I could function, but without the promise of alcohol I felt there was no reason to live. When I hit my rock bottom I met a paramedic who changed my life and perspective on things. He showed me there was more to life then getting shit faced. I had my last hoorah on October 5, 2020, of course it was day drinking. Well morning drinking. I got plastered on the steps of the courthouse. I'm missing most of that day, but I remember sobering up at McDonald's. At roughly 5:45pm I was sober. I promised myself when I started drinking that day to only have enough to enjoy. That's the last time I got drunk or even had a drop of alcohol. It's 6:30pm October 5, 2021 and I am proud to say I am 1 year sober. One whole year sober. I'll be honest I didn't think it was possible. It still scares me, what if I relapse after getting this far? What if I fail everyone? It's scary, but at least I can say is that in this moment I did it. Now I KNOW I can do it. I hope I don't slip, but it's one day at a time.

At 5am I finally searched for AA meetings near me. I’m super sporadic and chaotic when I’m drinking so I left the house even though it didn’t start for another 2 and a half hours. I hit the gas station and bought a tall boy. Turns out the meeting didn’t start until 9am. To kill time I went to my sister-in-law’s place and helped her take her son to school. Thank GOD she was awake. She actually ended up going to the meeting with me! When we got there it was exactly what I remembered from when I was 13 in rehab being forced to attend AA. A bunch of old geezers who all knew each other… but this time I was there by choice and everyone was soooo kind and welcoming. Meeting one of the women was really special for me. In minutes of meeting each other she was hugging me and I just broke down in tears. I guess because I felt hopeful for once. I know the meetings alone do not keep you sober but for once I finally felt like I had the ability to let go of this chain on my life. Everyone at that meeting this morning read passages that stuck with both my sister in law and me. They didn’t urge us to think of recovery with God in a religious way and that’s great because we’re very spiritual in a different way. I was white faced, emotional, hadn’t slept in 24 hours, drunk as piss, head throbbing, and I look over at my sister and see her wiping tears and knew that we were both meant to be there today. I’m happy I made this choice, and when I came home my husband told me how proud he was of me. Here’s to about 6 hours sober!!! I hope there’s many more to come. What I’m telling myself right now is that even though I see literally everyone relapse at some point, I can’t use that as an excuse to drink again. Like “oh it’s okay I can drink tonight and start my journey again tomorrow…” because I really have that tendency to give myself any excuse to drink. Hell, I’ll drink to not drinking! So stupid. So right now I’m working on deciding if I should cancel upcoming parties I’m hosting and events I’m going to because alcohol is everywhere in my life. I’m not sure if being around it right now is a good idea even though I’d like to think I could resist. I’ve also been reminding myself that I hate who I am when I drink.

I posted here a couple of days ago and everyone was extremely kind and generous with advice, thank you so much. I’m hoping for a couple of further tips please if anyone has any.


My mental health team who I have been under the care of for one year (major depression and suicide attempt) have referred me today to the substance abuse/alcoholism team. Apparently it will take about 2-3 weeks for them to get in touch. 


I asked about attending AA meetings but for now they have advised to try their professionals first. I have not ruled out AA and still very open to attending in future. For now, I am looking for some tips for how to get to at least one day of sobriety? In the past I had reasons not to drink (although that hasn’t always been enough to stop me) because the next day I needed to work, exercise class etc. But these days depression has wiped my motivation, I’m out of work, I basically lie in bed as much as possible which I am not proud of. Drinking is about the only thing I look forward to. I feel if I can crack one day of not drinking here and there, it will be easier for me to be productive on and off over the coming weeks.


I am supposed to be studying for the last year of my degree as a mature student which started on Saturday. But I haven’t even looked at it. It is flexible learning so I don’t have a fixed schedule unlike a traditional university. This is something that should be motivating me to get sober but isn’t.


Essentially, I am looking for tips as to how to beat the craving. Today I promised myself I would not drink, but once evening came around again, I did it. How to combat these cravings? I have heard of “surf the urge” but I always automatically dismiss it in my head. I was planning to distract myself tonight by watching a TV show but the temptation was too great.

My roommate hit 1 year sober through AA about 2 months ago. He seems to have subbed seltzer water in for beers and it works for him from what I can see.

I can't imagine that if it came to that point, I would want to have near beers around me.

First time - long time alcoholic. He went willingly. I expected his case manager to spend time talking to us about his departure from teh facility. I expected the facility to communicate with his psyciatrist and therapist (they work as a team). I have had to push HARD to get that communication to happen. My biggest concern being the facility wants to release my husband earlier than his therapist and psyhciatrist think they should. I understand this is my husbands decision but he says he is open to have the conversation with his Dr and the facility staff. I expected the facilty to communicate with the family about post release plans. About strategies if we suspect a relapse. I am meeting with active agression from his case manager as to what she sees as my ""questioning her credentials"". It's to the point where I realize there's no point in my talking to this person anymore. My husband isn't helpful becuase - while he agreed to talk to his therapist - he's obviously not eager to prolong his stay. I get that.  I just feel like the facility is going through the motions. But this is where I am. Any advice on opening the lines of communication with the facility? Though I suspect that's not going to happen. So more importantly any advice for supporting someone as they leave  inpatient treatment? I started al anon. He says he plans to go to AA meetings.

For the wise have always known that no one can make much of his life until self-searching becomes a regular habit, until he is able to admit and accept what he finds, and until he patiently and persistently tries to correct what is wrong.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88

I have more than enough to handle today, without dragging along yesterday's baggage too.  I must balance today's books, if I am to have a chance tomorrow.  So I ask myself if I have erred and how I can avoid repeating that particular behavior.  Did I hurt anyone, did I help anyone, and why?  Some of today is bound to spill over into tomorrow, but most of it need not if I make an honest daily inventory.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 94

I love spending time in my garden feeding and pruning my beautiful flowers.  One day, as I was busily snipping away, a neighbor stopped by.  She commented, 'Oh!  Your plants are so beautiful, it seems such a shame to cut them back.'  I replied, 'I know how you feel, but the excess must be removed so they can grow stronger and healthier.'  Later I thought that perhaps my plants feel pain, but God and I know it's part of the plan and I've seen the results.  I was quickly reminded of my precious A.A. program and how we all grow through pain.  I ask God to prune me when it's time, so I can grow.

Basically the epitome of the ""if you had my life, you would drink like I drink "" syndrome. 

I had an alcoholic father that was the kind to tell my mother that if she left him, he'd kill all of us. So we ran around the country hiding during my childhood.  New schools every few months because he would find us, etc. I saw a lot of violence blah blah. So my mom tried her best to help me and had me seeing counselors really young. 

I learned right away these counselors show sympathy for you when you tell them things.  They told me I've seen too much. That im traumatized. That im different than normal healthy kids and im going to need ongoing treatment, likely forever. As I grew up, I was diagnosed with more and more. PTSD, bi-polar disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety and panic attacks. They even told me that I had a chemical imbalance. That i lacked the natural ""feel good"" chemicals normal people have... And I was prescribed more and more. 

People with fancy degrees assuring me that I have valid medical and psychological issues requiring chemical treatment. Shit... Thats all you had to say!

Of course if I have to be medicated to live through all my mental issues and chemical imbalances, I may as well be the one to choose which meds make me feel better. The ones they prescribed really never did much for me. After much experimentation, I settled on liquor being the most effective chemical solution.  It was the only thing that worked AND it was all natural, legal, easy to get, and didn't require a prescription and dependence on the medical industrial complex. Win-win.

Then I drank to a point of dependency where when they separated me from liquor, I had a seizure, respiratory failure, delirium tremens, and had to use a walker to learn to walk again.  Liquor quit working and I was out of options. The plan was to go to AA a bit to show my family that I at least tried something before drinking myself to death.

A little over a year sober and I recently got to step 12 with my sponsor. I finally got honest. Im not crazy. Im just a drunk! I don't have PTSD, just been through a bit more drama than some.  Drama, not trauma!  I needed a spiritual solution, not a chemical solution this whole time. 

When I stopped living in the problem and started living in the solution, the problem went away!

I've been sober for a little over 3 years, have not been to an AA meeting since picking up my one year coin. Did my 90 in 90 to start off and walked through the 12 steps with a sponsor, over my first year in AA. Let me start by saying AA and my sponsor ABSOLUTELY saved my life. I still make a weekly gratitude list, still meditate, still journal daily, and still keep in touch with many others in my home group. 

I left due to absolutely loathing the idea of giving it up to a higher power. I know I'm a cliche, just an atheist struggling with the concept like many others I suppose. I'd you've read into Bills past you'll know he's ran into similar situations and also medically took LSD, and it rejuvenated is spirituality if you will. 

I would like to use the psychedelics as a way to explore my own spirituality.  I've volunteered at John's Hopkins for studies, this would be something I would like to do with professionals as I've never done it before. I was more of a blow and whiskey guy.

I’ve always used alcohol as a crutch, in an unhealthy way. At one time when I was younger I used to drink all day including before and during work, to combat social anxiety. Over the years I’ve noticed that I drink more than my peers and in bad times, drink quite a lot, most nights of the week. But then again there have been months and years where I’ve not been a problem drinker at all, drinking similar amounts as others or much less, and only at weekends. 


Over the past year I’ve been drinking a lot at weekends, sometimes everyday, getting drunk in the early evening and my family have expressed concern. After that happened I did manage to reduce it to about 3-4 times per week and drinking a bit less. But over the last couple of months I’ve been drinking every day (with a few days off in the last couple of weeks). I’m out of work at the moment so no routine or motivation not to drink. About a bottle of wine and a half each evening. It’s not huge amounts but I don’t think it’s healthy and it is effecting me the next day, eg super hangover. I don’t have the shakes or anything like that and I don’t believe any kind of physical addiction. Would you say I’m an alcoholic?


Also, I am currently under psychiatric support for major depression and suicide attempt. I see a professional once a week to discuss my treatment and progress. A number of times over the past year they have asked if I’d like to be referred to the alcohol support workers. I’ve always declined as I’ve not felt I’m at that point and also feel a bit embarrassed seeking alcohol support when I’m only drinking a bottle and a half of wine a night. I know some people can drink a lot throughout the day so would feel like I was wasting the professionals time who could be helping others who are having a tougher time. Do you think I should be referred?

Someone I know from the program relapsed and while they were high not long ago they set themself on fire accidentally. They burned their entire face, part of their arm, and their hand. I guess they were setting something on fire and accidentally switched up their lighter fluid container with a container of gasoline ( ??!!!?!) and they caught fire. They could’ve died. Their face looked terribly injured obviously. They have gone through several procedures like skin grafts already and their injuries and appearance have come a long way, but they do not look the same and I can’t imagine they will ever really look like what they did before setting themself on fire. I will say they look the best I’ve ever seen someone with that intense of facial burns look after reconstructive surgery or whatever procedures were done, so they are lucky for that and that they are safe and didn’t die. Still, of course no one wants to go through that and that’s got to be a horrifically traumatic thing to go through and live with for the rest of your life. This is what relapse looks like though. This could be any of us if we don’t get and stay sober.

Things don’t stay like they were the last time you drank or used. They don’t get better. It’s not chill. They always get worse, and usually they get worse much faster than the time before. Alcoholics and addicts cannot learn to use or drink in a normal, social, safe way. We cannot. I’ve tested it and failed. The first time I got sober I thought maybe I wasn’t realllyyyyy an alcoholic because I hadn’t gone to jail, ruined a marriage, lost a career, etc. I went back out and then guess what happened? I ended up going to jail 3 separate times when I was 21 because I got 2 duis a couple months apart. I was lucky I didn’t hurt somebody else or myself or crash. I’m sure that would’ve been in my not so distant future had I not been stripped of my ability to drive then gotten sober. I’ve been sober thanks to my higher power, my people, and this program for 5 years. You all can do it, too. Really, if I can, you can, too. I was fucked. There’s plenty of times I could’ve died. 

Back to the person with burn accident. They’ve got several kids. What’s next after you burn your fucking face off? When is it enough? Now the hospital is giving them heavy drugs for their pain, which I’m sure they honestly need right now, but will this be their wakeup call? I know them pretty well, and sadly I don’t think so. It *might* be one of the many wakeup calls they’ve had through the years where they try again for a bit and then relapse again in a few months or a year. I kind of doubt they aren’t driving their kids around while they’re high. Will they get into a wreck while high with their kids in the car? I sure as fuck hope not, but these are the thoughts and worries you have about someone when they’re already at the point where they’ve accidentally burned their face off while high. 

They are a person who has probably been to rehab about 7 times at this point over more than a decade I’m pretty sure. I used to be their sponsor, so I know what they’re like and why they haven’t stayed sober. They made excuses all the time from the very beginning on why they can’t do 90 meetings in 90 days for example. They didn’t give their all and put their heart and soul into their steps. They’re a bullshitter. They lash out and cast people out of their lives when they try to tell them the truth for their own good. They surround themselves with yes men who oftentimes use them. They are not rigorously honest. They seem so self-deluded that they believe their own lies even when they’re sober and of course more when they’re not sober I’m sure. They’ve lost custody of their kids before. And those kids are fucking awesome. This person is also fucking awesome when they want to be and are fully capable of succeeding, being a great parent, and going on to help other people and live a good life, but they have not done the things they need to do to stay sober. Don’t take that path. I beg you. It breaks my fucking heart.

I’m not sharing this to shame anyone or any actions. I know this is a horrible and debilitating disease and I made my fair share of awful decisions that hurt myself and others before I got sober. Hell, I’ve done some dumbass shit in sobriety, too, but I have kept moving forward and growing and doing the shit I need to do to stay sober and make progress. This is seriously a simple program. Yes, it can be hard as hell sometimes, but if you make excuses and don’t keep going, you will pay the price and so will the people who love you. I just wanted to share this because this news has shaken me to my core, and it has reminded me of the reality of this disease and made me even more grateful to still be sober. The tragedies we and others go through are awful, but they are the truth of the disease of alcoholism and addiction and we have to remember that. Let them be a lesson and a time to check in with ourselves and be grateful for what we have. 

TLDR: Someone I know relapsed and accidentally set themself on fire while high and burned their entire face. They could’ve died. They’re an awesome person when they want to be when they’re sober, but they are a chronic relapsed because they don’t do the work to stay sober. This could be me or any of us if we relapsed. The consequences of this disease are absolutely brutal and just get worse and worse each time we relapse or the longer we keep drinking. Please do what you need to do, because you can get and stay sober. I’ve been sober 5 years. Pretty much anyone can do it if they work the program.

When on the roller coaster of emotional turmoil, I remember that growth is often painful.  My evolution in the A.A. program has taught me that I must experience the inner change, however painful, that eventually guides me from selfishness to selflessness.  If I am to have serenity, I must STEP my way past emotional turmoil and its subsequent hangover, and be grateful for continuing spiritual progress.

A lot of infidelity material that i've read suggests using ""justifiable anger"" to fuel getting through this and make myself a better person, and make a better life.  But the BB says that anger is the luxury of normal men.  And justifiable resentments are probably the most dangerous. 

I don't feel like drinking over this.  I want to do the next right thing so I can make it out of this happy, and keep my daughter happy and protected.  

""We realized that the people who wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick. Though we did not like their symptoms and the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended we said to ourselves, “This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done.”

I am having a hell of a time balancing boundaries/not taking any more bullshit with the 'tolerance, pity and patience' part.  She's already sleeping with other men, and then texts me the next day that she misses me. 

I have talked to my sponsor, but he is in the middle of a lot right now in his life, and I can't get his input as much as I would like.

Almost the same happened last night. I was partying after the clubs just opened again. In my memory I got in trouble with some people and was followed by these as well. I called my mother out of fear and after I sobered up, she told me that I was talking a lot of nonsense.

I am not sure what exactly happened and what this could be, but after looking through the internet, I stumbled over the so called ""alcohol psychosis"".

To finally be able to sit quietly with me without reaching for a drink or a drug or some other addictive filler (shopping, eating, obsessive behaviors, overfocusing on things, too much work, too much exercise).  For me, there is a second part of the AA program where my life got immensely better.  The barbaric behavior went away and I started looking after others.

Anxiety and malaligned behaviors were my biggest challenge.  Next year will be 3 years sober before the incident(s).  This whole past year has been filled with an intuition that only the Universe could provide.  I reclaimed my career after two years of searching.  My immediate family doesn't drink anymore because of what happened.  I'm helping my sister get sober.  I amended relationships and those people went off to mend ties with their old friends.

My last two are only 17 months apart and being the only one to care for them really took a toll on me mentally. And so I turned to drinking in the shadows. I had bottles hidden in the apt, my car. In random cups to disguise that I was drinking. No one really knew because I still handled tasks in my day to day life. Over the course of the years I was drinking on and off. Was able to quit for 5 months last year while quitting with my then boyfriend but eventually with our break up, life stresses and chaos I picked up that bottle again. Living on my own it became even worse because I sat alone in my thoughts and I lost the will power to stay focused in workouts and I let alcohol consume me and ruin my friendships, my family, my work and my relationship. My life became unmanageable. I moved out of state 2 months ago and being away from all my family took a toll on me daily. There came the alcohol, the only thing to comfort and numb me in the shadows. I isolated myself to my room and drank every night and day letting depression and anxiety keep me down. I let alcohol once again take control of me whether I was alone or surrounded by my kids. I had the desire to quit, I was missing out on so much in life including being present in my children’s. I mentioned it to my family that I wanted to quit. Earlier this week I came out of work to a letter from my son with a picture of my kids. In the letter he’s talking about how he and his siblings are there for me and how proud he is of me for making the decision to move here, for all my hard work at work and at home and for the then 3 days I didn’t have a drink. It was his letter and appreciation and acknowledgment of my efforts that helped me walk through the doors of my first AA meeting yesterday. It was the best thing I could’ve done. I felt welcomed and my heart at peace to hear everyone else share their stories and to be able to relate to each person.

 Here is a little back story:

A few years ago, my little brother was killed in a farming accident right before I entered law school. This led to a series of events that would include to me drinking a fifth or two of hard liquor everyday combined with around 10-12mg of Xanax or 18-20mg of Klonopin. I was also doing MDMA 4-5 times a week, and occasionally smoking crack and meth. I did this on a daily basis, save for the occasional week or two of guilt related abstinence. Inevitably, I lost my scholarship and was reprimanded for frequently going to lectures under the influence. My fiancee left me, and I accidentally overdosed on a Xanax laced with fentanyl in August of 2020. This was still not enough for me to stop. I was essentially in a semi-permanent state of blackout, my ability to plan, reason, or even remember basic details about important events was almost non-existent. I struggled to maintain employment, and got to the point where I was isolating from the few remaining people that I hadn't alienated. After a couple failed stints in rehab, this all came to a head when in April, while on my way to cover a baseball game for the local newspaper, I got a DUI. I blew a .27, and was promptly fired. 

So then I unsuccessfully tried to drink myself to death. Once I had drained my bank accounts into the red, I didn't know what to do. Out of money, friends, food, booze and pills, I knew if I was going to continue to live, I needed to get help. Luckily, I found a halfway house a couple hours away that my insurance covered who said they would admit me. The problem was, it required 72 hours of sobriety. So the next day I found a ride, lied about how long I had sober, and checked myself in. I had the experience of going through extreme withdrawal without the aid of any medication over the next couple weeks. Eventually, I leveled out and I was surprised when my mind cleared a lot quicker than I expected. I became dedicated to my recovery, and attended the 90 meetings in 90 days that so many AA's deem essential.

After three months, I had secured a decent paying and stable job working at the corporate office of a bank. I got my own apartment, and moved out of the halfway house. My DUI got dismissed on a technicality, and my license was reinstated. I even got admitted into graduate school at the local university to get my MBA in Accounting.

But the thing is, I started smoking weed again a couple months ago (I live fairly close to a dispensary). Having PTSD and chronic pain from a motorcycle accident some years ago, it seems to be the one thing other than alcohol which gives me psychological relief. I know this is frowned upon, but I gotta say, it's working. I feel a lot more grounded and less depressed. While I have heard countless stories about people relapsing on their drug/drink of choice after resuming cannabis usage, I have not had that desire whatsoever. 

This choice has led to issues related to my local AA circle. After telling my girlfriend in confidence, she broke up with me over it, and started telling people I had relapsed at meetings when I wasn't there. Friendships have ended, and I have been lying about it to my sponsor to avoid judgment. 

I feel like this response is counter-intuitive to the purpose of AA, of which the only requirement is a desire to stop drinking, which I did. Now I'm in a position where I need to choose between my own mental health, or acting like a had some big relapse to appease these fair-weather friends in the program. Truth be told, I'm a little disgusted. It all comes off as disingenuous, where uncompromising adherence to the accepted status quo (not even principles or steps) is required for support and acceptance, and I'm not about that. I don't think I should have to change what is working for me to get the approval of people that are blindly following their ""crowd"" with little to no independent thought about the real complexity of addiction, or how everyone's experience in recovery is different. I'm frustrated, and I feel a little betrayed by these individuals who I had grown to consider friends.

Before the semester started I had a lot more time for meetings. During the week now I simply don’t have time to get to a meeting every single day. They tell me to prioritize AA #1. What about my physical and mental health? Personally, I am so busy that I don’t even have time to think about a drink. 
I have 12 hour days when school is in session. By the time I get home I want to eat dinner, shower, relax, and be in bed asleep by 9 or 10pm. 
Sometimes I feel like an hour at the gym is better for my well-being than an hour at AA. I also call my sponsor every day and keep in contact with other alcoholics daily. I write the daily reflections in my journal every day and write on it. 
I’m staying sober, in my right mind, working my own version of the program. And trust me, when I am available,  I’m at meetings every weekend. I even chair a meeting every Saturday, and I have another service position. It just frustrates me when people assume things about me or my story and think that just because I can’t attend meetings every single day of the week that I’m not living in the program.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,38147,public,self,I’m a little frustrated,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pzuyg0/im_a_little_frustrated/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

As we work the first nine Steps, we prepare ourselves for the adventure of a new life.  But when we approach Step Ten we commence to put our A.A. way of living to practical use, day by day, in fair weather or foul.  Then comes the acid test: can we stay sober, keep in emotional balance, and live to good purpose under all conditions?

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 88

I know the Promises are being fulfilled in my life, but I want to maintain and develop them by the daily application of Step Ten.  I have learned through this Step that if I am disturbed, there is something wrong with me.  The other person may be wrong too, but I can only deal with my feelings.  When I am hurt or upset, I have to continually look for the cause in me, and then I have to admit and correct my mistakes.  It isn't easy, but as long as I know I am progressing spiritually, I know that I can mark my effort up as a job well done.  I have found that pain is a friend; it lets me know there is something wrong with my emotions, just as a physical pain lets me know there is something wrong with my body.  When I take the appropriate action through the Twelve Steps, the pain gradually goes away.

2 years alcohol free here. Just got back from a data at a trendy restaurant. Being hip and all, water was served out of liquour bottles. ex. our table had a tequila bottle with water inside.

Even though I'm sure this tequila bottle had been cleaned out, it still made me nervous to drink water that had been in the same container as tequila. I did just want to go with the flow and so drank water out of this tequila bottle.

The water tasted like water, nothing funny about it, etc. But I am thinking about alcohol now - probably just a placebo effect. But I'm wondering if I could have ingested any tequila or other alcohol from this?

TLDR: IS it safe for recovering alcoholics to drink water out of tequila or vodka bottles that have been cleaned and refurbished as water containers?

Recently he said he didn't know why he did it (drinking) and that he was gonna stop. Of course he wouldn't be able to do it by himself, but he denied external help like AA or a psychiatrist; and of course he started drinking again in less than a month.

Now, I don't live with him. In fact, I live in another state, but I'm visiting and I'm close to his house. We were supposed to travel together, but because he is drinking heavily again, I called it off and told him about it. But I still want to sit down and talk to him, in person, and be serious about this. I've scheduled and paid for a psychiatrist for him to go on Monday. So this would be the talk: I want to help you, please admit you need help, the psychiatrist it paid for.

But what is the best way to say this? I don't know how to talk in way that is 1) loving; 2) effective and 3) serious, having in mind that he is been an alcoholic for almost 30 years. What should be my approach? How not to offend him or get him defensive?

In his shoes, what would you like to hear from your daughter or anyone close to you that wants to help you? Or, if you're not a (recovery/recovered) alcoholic, have you ever helped anyone in this manner and what did work for you?

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels.  We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 85

When I am in pain it is easy to stay close to the friends I have found in the program.  Relief from that pain is provided in the solutions contained in A.A.'s Twelve Steps.  But when I am feeling good and things are going well, I can become complacent.  To put it simply, I become lazy and turn into the problem instead of the solution.  I need to get into action, to take stock: where am I and where am I going?  A daily inventory will tell me what I must change to regain spiritual balance.  Admitting what I find within myself, to God and to another human being, keeps me honest and humble.

Last month was my 30th birthday.  I got sober, in AA, at 22.

Needless to say, when I was a kid or a teenager I didn't expect that by the time I was 22 I'd have already been an alcoholic and in recovery.  But that's how things ended up working out.

It's been a relatively tough year for me.  I've had a string of medical problems that, while none of them super serious, have been very annoying and made day-to-day life a hassle.  It all started with the realization and diagnosis that I had tinnitus and some minor hearing loss, presumably from too much rock and roll.  I never expected it to happen to me, but it did (protect your ears!)  Luckily it's not too bad, but it was hard to come to terms with it.  Some days I still struggle.

In the last few years since getting sober I took a liking to being fit and active.  Unfortunately, I pushed things a little too hard, and about 4 months ago I developed a pain in my foot that basically kept me off my feet for 3 whole months.  I decided to try swimming, and due to improper technique, I injured my back, too.  I was really angry.   It's like I couldn't get a good streak going.

But what they taught me in AA was ""life's terms, not mine"".  My foot has healed.  My back has healed.  I still have tinnitus but I've come to terms with it.  You know what would have happened back when I was drinking?  I would have self-destructed.  

Nowadays it's completely different for me.  I remember someone shared this at an AA meeting once: ""now I have problems, but I just walk through them"".  That's what I did.  One day at a time.  Despite the annoyance, frustration, and all the other crap.  Sometimes all you have to do is *keep going*.  I guess that's why they say ""keep coming back"".

Writing it all out now it all seems like pretty small stuff, but in the moment it's horrific.  It brings up the question, for me, of ""what the hell is even the point of all this anyway if it's just going to be one thing after another?""  That's what it brought up in me.  But I kept going.

And thanks to that, not only did I remain sober, but I also had the opportunity to do some really cool things.  I started reading a lot this year.  I took to writing more seriously.  I got more comfortable with myself and had an easier time doing what I wanted to do.  I didn't experience so much anxiety or depression.  I fell in love and enjoyed it.  

I think that's the greatest gift of sobriety: not only does it save us from self-destruction, it also gives us the opportunity to do something really cool with our lives.  It just takes a little patience sometimes.

If I had to draw any broad conclusion from these 8 years, it's that things *do* get better.  You have to be a little courageous, that much is true.  But you don't have to be superhuman.  All you have to do is follow your heart, and learn to trust.  If you can do that, somehow, things tend to work out.  It's OK to relax.  It's OK to be yourself.  It's OK to enjoy life. 

Life is truly beautiful, and I have sobriety and the foundation I learned in AA for giving me this second chance.

In the past months I've been to a couple of rehabs and had 90 days under my belt Friday. However, Friday I slipped and had a few drinks at her apartment that I visit on the weekends because I live in a half way house that only allows overnights on the weekends. I'll provide better context.

So she works often times 7 days a week at bars that close very late, the one she works at majority of the time closes at 4am. So since I've been out of rehab and at this house, the past several weekends Ive been picking up her apt keys while shes at work and go to her place to hang out, enjoy not being around other guys in a home setting and enjoying her much more comfortable bed so we can spend sometime together when she gets off very late. Now we've had some strain in the past about her work life and how she can be not great at scheduling because often she'll sleep for 10 plus hours then go start into work mood (we agree she probably has a sleep disorder but that's another conversation). So the constraints of the house rules during the week and limitations of the weekend make it so there is super limited time together as is so this was a win win dynamic.

So more on how the life style conflicts. She mainly has only friends in the service industry and mainly spends non working hours of leisure at the bar(s) she works at or in a casual party setting aka alcohol around aplenty. The past couple weekends if I wanted to see her before she crawled into bed after the next day's sunup I would hang out at the bar shes tending and its a dive so there is time for us to steal little interactions and moments together. I was geniunely confident in my program to be able to hang out there but also had the ability to know when its getting too much and say Im going to leave. Kind of. The past three weekends I gently told her Im ready to go and she innocently did the ""sure thing! Give me a few to say goodbye and everything"" but still a few hours would go by. Or I would leave right when I wanted/needed to and when she would get off work early enough to where we could have some quality time one on one at her place (no innuendo intended) she chose or ""got guilted"" into staying out/ going out with her bar friends.

Which bring me to Friday. I walked into her room and theres a full glass of wine right next to her bed. This isnt the first time something like that happened, a couple weeks prior she had a plate with a small bit of cocaine left from hanging out with coworker friends. She did have issues with coke in the past but it is now a couple times in the span of a 6 months thing. I ask every so often about it and she assures its not an issue and I trust so I take that as it. So I drank that wine not cuz of her or the bad traffic or my depression kicking my ass that week, I drank because I chose to drink. All this focus on her choices and behavior, none of that is a deflection, I take fully ownership of my relaspe. I do. I told her what happened within 10 mins of her getting home, she yelled and called me a fucking asshole and said Im not allowed to hang out at her place like weve been doing anymore. After we both cooled down, I agreed that is probably a good call and I shouldnt be bar visiting anymore. Like the wine glass being around it close enough to smell it, was way too much for me. I told my sponsor the next day (I drank at like 2am on that friday so I told sponsor saturday).  But during the post confession talk she was crying saying she's scared our lives might not be capatable and she feels torn between me and bartending which she really does love.

And admittedly I have had a blinspot for her with asserting boundaries in the recent past. In the spring which I in the end stages of denial of my alcoholism, I told her I was having a bad week with drinking and was looking forward to an evening of quality time with her. We go to a nice dinner and movie, and after she wanted to keep the night going so she asked if we could go to a bar after the movie. I said okay as long as its not gonna be too late which was true but she ended up getting semi sloppy drunk (which is rare for her around me or not) so much so that when we were fooling around later that night I had to use our safeword because she was biting and scratching too hard to the point where she popped a blood vessel in my lip from biting.

The other big and recent example was we went to her cousin's wedding over the summer and this was after my first go in rehab and real attempt at sobriety. She asked if it was okay mutiple times for her to have only a couple drinks at the wedding which i really did think was fine. Well throughout the weekend she made several comments and I see it in her demeanor she was craving time with family (mainly her cousins that shes close with- mutiple of them have been in each others wedding parties including my gf  they just live all over the US). Seeing them take shots and get dancy she asked if it was okay if she drank some more which I said was fine. I was semi fine with it but on the 14 plus drive over she without prompting from me said she wouldnt drink period on the trip, so with some permission from the guidelines kept moving partially out of guilt from depriving her from a time with she was craving and/or the fear that she would low key feel I deprived her of it.

So semi in conclusion, I really do love this woman and she does me. She has been a catalyst for me seeking self improvement before and after admitting my disease. Friday evening did include a talk about how I havent put myself in smart situations but also reviewing how her/our social life needs readjusting. She cried and shes been feeling like shes been a bad partner. There's also a recent thing about we/she talked up so much about visiting me in rehab but overslept and missed the time window. I assured her she is absolutely not and she has helped me tremendously throughout our relationship. But there is strains. We are SO dependent on her schedule in order to see each other. Its always been like that in our relationship, spending time together on her terms basically. I explained to her Friday how cravings work and how scienctifically a craving can be as strong as the mental feeling of starving or being real thrist. I've asked her and she excitedly agreed months ago to go to Alano but still hasnt and now getting irked when i mention it since she ""is strapped for time."" But I think my fear over this leading to more conflict and to be super honest the downfall of our relationship culminated in me deciding to drink.

So TLDR: I am in early recovery and trying to avoid alcohol while my gf's lifestyle actively is surrounded by it.

The program, my sponsor and my renewed faith is helping me so much. 

I thank God that I learned about AA.  But how did so many AA members from various walks of life know that we all suffered from this disease that was “but a symptom?”

It's hard to explain where i'm at. On one side I have found the resilience to give up on something that once had it's claws all wrapped around my inner self. It dictated how I felt and whispered lies of comfort. 

Today I sit here, wondering what did it take? What has changed? Why when I think of drugs or alcohol do I no longer feel intimidated or drawn by it. Reading through my facebook posts from the last 8 months I come to realise that a lot of it is due to me facing myself. Yet lately, I find myself ignoring a lot. People I dearly miss and wish I had the courage to reach out to. Things I desperately would want to have the courage to undertake. All in all, life has truly been a blessing. I have met some wonderful people that have given me more to appreciate than just my own centre of a world. Look within myself is still a daily task. It's not a bad one though, it's alleviating to remind myself that I am not the center of things. Every day is a hill I climb in order to get closer and closer to my ultimate goal. And even If I never reach the top, I can find peace in knowing that i'm trying every day to maintain active what keeps me sober. I think back and as dark as things have been and sometimes still are, I really feel liberated. Truly find so much serenity in knowing that i'm doing best and upholding standards I strive to live up to every day.

I have so much gratitude for the people in my lives. Every single one them have brought me where I am today and I thank them for doing so. Wether for better or worse, I finally can say that i'm confident about how I feel. Will things get rough? Possibly. As long as I take it a day at a time and don't let my own head get the best of me, I know i'll be fine.

It is in the acceptance of how things are that I can find serenity. Finding peace and finding love is all that matters. I embrace life fully and feel it all again. Laughing like a child brings me back to a place of no sorrows. Allowing myself to feel is what truly is beautiful about life. Nothing compares to how determined I am to never go back to how things were. It wasn't so much about not drinking and so much more about not wanting to.

Today I can say confidently that I want to be sober and embrace the feelings that come with it. I no longer want to ignore and undermine myself. My feelings matter to me and I am ok with them being around.

- A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 139

Early in my A.A. life, I became employed in its services and I found the explanation of our society's logo to be very appropriate.  First, a circle of love and service with a well-balanced triangle inside, the base of which represents our Recovery through the Twelve Steps.  Then the other two sides, representing Unity and Service, respectively.  The three sides of the triangle are equal.  As I grew in A.A. I soon identified myself with this symbol.  I am the circle, and the sides of the triangle represent three aspects of my personality: physical, emotional sanity, and spirituality, the latter forming the symbol's base.  Taken together, all three aspects of my personality translate into a sober and happy life.

She started drinking after her 4 month miscarriage. Her child was her reason to start living a productive and healthy life- then she lost her baby. She has no will to live anymore, and I’m incredibly worried about her wellbeing/desire to kill herself. 

We’ve known each other for 3 months, and we met on Tinder. We’ve basically just been fwb, and I have no desire to pursue sex anymore, so I deleted Tinder/all other dating apps, and was going to tell her I’m not interested in casual sex anymore. However, the past couple days she opened up about how she’s feeling, and her past. I only learned about her alcoholism yesterday, as she now has to go to the hospital for detox. 

I don’t know what to do. Taking care of her emotionally is affecting my schooling and my goals, but I’m scared to just leave abruptly due to her suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. I know she's going to relapse due to the grief of losing her kid. I can't let my life be affected by a girl I've only known for 3 months and was just a long-term hookup, but I also won't drop someone in their worst condition.

(My previous 3 were 10 years ago.) I spent 4 and 1/2 terrifying days in jail. I was blacked out when the arrest happened so I really didn't know what had happened until I got out. I started going to meetings the day after I got out of jail. Really threw myself into the program, got a sponsor, worked the steps and things slowly started getting better. 

I even made some friends, including a man with ""4 years of Sobriety"" that I became fairly close with. He ended up wanting to be more than friends, I told him I wasn't really interested in him like that but he was really, really persistent and to be honest it felt really nice to have someone pay so much attention to me. He was always there if I needed something and checked in on me. But he also had a tendency to gossip about other people in the program, telling me who was ""actually sober"" who smoked pot or did other drugs and it got in my head. 

The day after my 6 month mark I said fuck it and got drunk for 3 days. Came back, first stepped. Made it 2 weeks, and I hung out with the guy again. Found out that in reality he didn't have the 4 years he claimed and that he'd drank periodically over the past year or so. And we got drunk together, for like a week straight. He went to detox and I went back to my meetings again. I told him we couldn't hang out any more. But he didn't really like that and started pursuing me more intently. I relapsed again one night and I was really down on myself about it and didn't know who to turn to, I'd stopped communicating with my sponsor by that time and I just struggled to find the courage to reach out to anyone else. But he reached out to me and the morning after he came over to ""help."" He gave me one of his oxys (I don't even like opiates??) And then he left to go get us lunch. He came back with a bunch of alcohol and we got hammered. The next day I told him that I absolutely couldn't hang out with him or even talk to him anymore and to stay away from me. 

But I haven't stopped drinking since. That was 3 weeks ago. I've been completely isolating myself, embarrassed and drunk and feeling like a piece of shit. I'm scared to go back to my meetings because I don't want to risk running into him again and because I'm ashamed and embarrassed by my weakness. 

I'm really going to try not to drink today, and hopefully find a new meeting where he won't be tomorrow. But I'm still just so embarrassed. I felt like I was doing so well and everything just came crashing down around me. I'm tired of feeling worthless and stupid and scared of everything. 

I don't want to bring this story up at the meetings here because the AA world is small in my town and there's a high probability someone would know who I'm talking about and I'm not trying to throw him under the bus. I know he's sick too and it's not his fault, I drank because I wanted to drink, not because of anything he did, but at the same time it's not a good situation. 

How do I pluck up the courage to walk back in and admit my failure and start over? Ugh. This whole thing just sucks 😞

I barely remember it like it was yesterday. On my last night of drinking, I promised not to get drunk, then drank alone in a garage through the entirety of a child's birthday party, drove my family home (drunk) and faded to black. I was sitting in my first AA meeting less than 24 hours later. 

AA saved my life. I don't care if it's a trope. I am alive today because the people in those rooms took me in, showed me the way and I was beat down enough to listen. There are so many close calls, drunk accidents, fights, health and legal issues and insane decisions... I really don't know how I survived long enough to even make it to the rooms but I know I wouldn't have made it much longer. 

I'm posting today to share my hope. I used to think I was a mid-bottom drunk because I never killed anyone or went to jail. I later heard from others I was probably a low-bottom drunk based on my story. Eventually, I realized it didn't matter. I was just a drunk. The important part is the recovery - and I am, through the power of something greater than myself, recovered. Not recover-ING. Recover-ED. As the book says, I have ""recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body"" through the 12 Steps. 

Since entering the program, the promises in the book have been fulfilled in my life. I have a peace I've never had. I have patience, I love deeper, I can experience being loved, I can provide and be of service. My marriage was saved, I lost 40 pounds, our sex is 20x better, I make triple what I did when I was drinking, I paid off all my taxes, lawsuits, legal fees and maxed out credit cards. I am a father to my kid - like an actually present one involved in her world. I've dealt with mental health issues previously hidden by self-medication with drugs and alcohol. You literally would not recognize me, whether looking at me or my actions. I still have problems, character defects and struggle. It's not perfect and it never will be. But it doesn't have to be and I know no substance or destructive behavior is going to fill that hole. The longing I felt will sometimes return - and when it does, there is a solution: the 12 Steps.

If you're new, if you're suffering, if you don't know what is going to get you out of the hell you are in: I suggest you give them a real shot. Taken as prescribed, with rigorous honesty, they really do work. Essentially, they're a catalyst to spiritual experience, or ""limit experience"", some might say. A way to induce a radical change in the way you view the world around you - and really a change in yourself. They work.

If you've got less time than me, I hope reading this inspires you. You should know reading your experiences and struggles on this sub inspires me, bringing the brutal truth of alcoholism freshly into my memory. It has a habit of fading. You keep me motivated. I'm grateful to have talked with a lot of people from this sub, and hopefully helped. There is a way out and you are on the right path. 

If you've got more time than me, I'm inspired by your strength and experience. Thank you for being here and passing hope and knowledge on to us youngins. 

I am just overwhelmingly grateful to the program, the community, and my higher power.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89

A man came to the meeting drunk, interrupted the speakers, stood up and took his shirt off, staggered loudly back and forth for coffee, demanded to talk, and eventually called the group's secretary an unquotable name and walked out.  I was glad he was there – once again I saw what I had been like.  But I also saw what I still am, and what I still could be.  I don't have to be drunk to want to be the exception and the center of attention.  I have often felt abused and responded abusively when I was simply being treated as a garden variety human being.  The more the man tried to insist he was different, the more I realized that he and I were exactly alike.

I started a new job, ironically in a treatment center, and we take the clients to AA every Saturday. I don't participate but I suddenly feel the calling to attend one of my own.

Someone please tell me it gets easier, you feel happier, and the cravings stop gnawing at you. It doesn't help that society is literally obsessed with alcohol.

I was forced by my mother to be her personal therapist, she always dumped all her shit on me and blamed me for not handling it perfectly. I was sexually abused by multiple people growing up, and both my parents were violent, throwing things around and punching holes in walls. I turned to alcohol at 14, and was an alcoholic until 18, when what I’m about to describe happened. 

Due to my abuse I was weird at school. I confided in people too quickly, I couldn’t keep my hands to myself, etc. I didn’t know how to make friends. But one boy (also 18 at the time) in particular gave me the time of day. He was kind to me… which was something that I was missing in my life. We began dating, but I was toxic. He cut me off, and I thought that if I really loved him, I couldn’t let him out of my grasp. 

I began stalking him and harassing him… I followed him home from school, would try to talk to him, I created multiple social media accounts to message him to the point of him having to delete his social media’s, etc. But one night, I got really drunk, and the amazing idea of breaking into his house came to me. I went to his house and entered through an open window, which led to his little sister’s bedroom. In a drunken rage I began yelling at her, and he and his parents rushed into the room to try and get me out. They ended up calling the police and I was arrested, there was a trial, and I ended up going to jail for a year. 

Since then I’ve been in therapy and have been required to do a 12 step program. I’m on the step of “making amends”, and that brought this back up in my mind. I’m certain that I traumatized that family, especially the little girl… do you think they would want to receive an apologetic letter from me?

I'm a 24 year old and I feel like I might be developing a problem. I've had previous encounters with many substances and despite struggling with very addictive ones  (benzos) I managed to give them up all on my own and have never looked back. 

Here in Australia alcohol is the only accepted ""drug"" and weed and all other substances are frowned upon which is completely fine but as they say: ""Everyone has their poison"", and very early on 14 or so mine was alcohol. 

I was hospitalized, I've woken up hours away from my home, I've ran face first into a fish tank, I've never done anything malignant or harmful to other ppl beyond when I drove drunk and nearly drove off a cliff a few years back.  Despite mostly ending my own life, If the story was written different I could have harmed someone else. I've tried to end my life and resorted to self harm a lot because of the way I am.

when I'm sober I honestly believe I'm in control despite knowing the impacts it's having on my work, life, mental health, family and it ruined a great relationship 2 years back.

The saddest part is, part of me honestly believes I'm still winning and in control when I give it time. 

It's like I recycle shit emotions for new ones each time.

I might stop for a day or two and say ""never again"" but I'm right back at it once the guilt takes it's course.

We have a massive drinking culture here in Aus and a lot of my friends are bonded over a beer so in regards of feeling lonely it's difficult. I'm also quite shy and find a few drinks let me have a good time. But I can't stop and often prefer drinking alone, so despite seeing friends I'll end up going home and continuing the drinking alone.

I moved from spirits to beer which was a massive help. I could limit myself at least and keep track. But it became a heavy hitter on the bank and also despite never being over weight I started to notice a beer gut. 

But I find myself stuck in this loop of what I have is not enough, and I wake up depressed and anxious about my decisions and actions the previous night, although most are not terrible or destructive; mostly talking to friends a bit to lively than usual, or staying up too late, I draw the line at not being able to wake up for work and messaging ppl at stupid hours when most ppl have a life and aren't up all night. It's embarrassing... I have gotten far better at controlling that which also worries me.

I use to work at a liquor store and I finally got a new job which I hoped would set me straight, and it did but I've found myself stuck in this same loop of ""If I only buy 4 beers it'll be fine"" and end up sourcing alcohol elsewhere after. 

I've obviously tried not drinking, but alcohol is all over my house, I could walk blindfolded and run into a long island iced tea.

I guess I'm scared that once I stop that is it I can't ever drink again. I loose my social life, I get bored of hanging out with the people I grew up with despite majority of them being far more interesting than I am and I end up just living a life more or less dedicated to fuck all.

It's also very family oriented, I have to learn to talk to my own family without drinking and watching them drink. This is very genetic alcoholism runs in my family.

I'm aware I need to stop, to be honest its just really shit that I have to... And honestly scary.

I appreciate it's short sighted, but it's hard to see new doors opening when you're so focused on the ones you wish you didn't have to close.

But this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside (the way I used to claim alcohol made me feel, except this is a real feeling). 

My fiancé is finally warming up to me again. My rock bottom wasn’t when I was hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning, fired from my job, woke up in strange places, injured my neck or broke a rib… What truly hit me and made me want to do this was my fiancé being one and a half feet out the door… Something about the thought of losing him made me take a long hard look at myself and something in my brain ticked and told me I HAVE to do this. I NEED change. For the sake of my life, my health, my future, my sanity and my family. I started putting in the work, attending meetings (sometimes 2 a day) and building a foundation to get and stay sober… One day, one moment at a time. 

He started holding my hand and saying “I love you” first again… He came on to me first for the first time in over a year. I can’t blame him since being 8 drinks deep, slurring and stumbling isn’t exactly a turn on. Nor was being depressed from booze or hungover… 

I was horrible to him… I was never mean or violent but him seeing me a drunken mess definitely took it’s toll. Him seeing me taken away in an ambulance or having to pick me up from a hospital cause I passed out drunk in public. Him coming home to seeing me passed out in the shower or after raiding the fridge. I was horrible to myself. I’d lie about how much I consumed and put alcohol before his feelings despite him always telling me (and me knowing yet denying) that it was a BIG problem. Nobody deserves to see their significant other in such a state… 

I’m truly blessed to have another chance… To be able to love myself and him right. To be able to show myself and him that I truly can change… Oppose to making empty promises about “next time” like I used to. Promising that it’ll “never happen again”…until it did…cause I didn’t take sobriety seriously or put in any effort whatsoever. But this time is and will be different. 

Yesterday we spent the entire day together.. We cuddled, held hands, played video games, went to the movies, laughed and enjoyed our time together. To truly be there for him… for us.. Felt amazing. To live and appreciate every moment. Even just running errands with him. Unlike when I was a drunk and didn’t know how to appreciate the simple things in life… Now every moment is a blessing. To have my best friend back… I can’t even begin to explain how happy I feel..

The work must continue. I won’t stop now just cause I’m finally getting the love of my life back. This is only the beginning.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 89

Sponsorship held two surprises for me.  First, that my sponsees cared about me.  What I had thought was gratitude was more like love.  They wanted me to be happy, to grow and remain sober.  Knowing how they felt kept me from drinking more than once.  Second, I discovered that I was able to love someone else responsibly, with respectful and genuine concern for that person's growth.  Before that time, I had thought that my ability to care sincerely about another's well-being had atrophied from lack of use.  To learn that I can love, without greed or anxiety, has been one of the deepest gifts the program has given me.  Gratitude for that gift has kept me sober many times.

I’ve known him since he was 13. All our lives growing up he’s always had emotional issues. It all started when some girl broke his heart when he was like 16. He become bitter and got anger issues. As time went on he got better and when he was 19 he started taking up smoking weed. It seemed to help him mellow out a lot but I noticed over the years he become very in his head and depressed. About 2 years ago he started to date a girl who was an alcoholic, she ended up cheating on him and it really hurt him. What made matters worse is he picked up her habits of drinking along the way. Now as the years passed he’s been in and out of jobs and also has gotten into another relationship that he isn’t happy in (says he is but then will complain about what she does to him. Some of the stuff is brutal) They finally broke up and now I’m just worried about him because he can’t stop drinking, he’s depressed about this girl and might get back with her and he hasn’t had a job since May. As a friend how do I handle this?

It started out not that bad but once he got into this new relationship about a year ago it’s gotten so much worse. Before it was subtle but now unfortunately I’m embarrassed to go out in public with him because he’ll start swearing and saying things out loud that you really shouldn’t. He also just looks not well kept. Weight gain, messy hair, untrimmed beard, dirty nails ect. It just looks like he’s given up and it hurts me to see.

Myself, his younger brother, mom and old work friends have reached our hand out to him numerous times and given so much advice but does the opposite of everything we tell him. I genuinely believe he wants help but then he won’t take it. We’ve all babied him by being sympathetic and we have also been super stern with him over the last couple years with the drinking.

I used to think I was a good person with a problem that needed fixing but I realised that when it came down to it I was just a good person when it's easy to be but I realised that for the last few years whenever I had to make a decision between the right choice or the selfish choice to get fucked up on drugs/alcohol/sex ignoring my responsibilities and the well bring of those around me I always chose the selfish option because it made me feel good/happy for awhile without caring for the consequences to make myself feel better just because I had a fucked up life with long lasting trauma that doesn't mean I have any right to potentially fuck up someone else's to make myself feel better for a few hours.

These last few years have possibly been the worst years of my life so bad that I tried to commit suicide by overdosing a few months ago. I never intended to hurt people intentionally I would never want to hurt the ones I love and innocent people but I have destroyed good meaningful relationships and hurt friends and loved ones and I've even put people into dangerous positions where someone could've been seriously injured or even killed. Everytime I would blackout I always used to think these were mistakes and that I was just a danger to myself but I realise now they weren't mistakes at all and that my self destructive choices have harmed other people.

I chose to do this shit over and over and over again even when I knew what could happen and that once I start drinking I can not stop. Something deep inside me wants to self destruct. I have been battling alcohol abuse since I was a teenager but no one controlled me or forced me, I gladly and willingly chose the ""fun"" option to make myself feel better by self medicating over the right one even when I knew the potential consequences but ""this time I can control myself"" I would tell myself. I'm so lucky I have never seriously harmed or injured someone else and that the only consequence is that some people hate me and avoid me even after I have apologised and even though they've accepted and pretend it's okay now but I can feel it whenever I happen to see them and I deserve it.  I can live with people hating me for being a fucking mess but I would never be able to forgive or live with myself if I seriously harmed anyone or caused someone's death that wasn't my own.

The reason why I realised these things about myself is because I have very slowly managed to pull myself out of the hole I was trying to get out of for the past 6 years 
(I've been going to therapy and I've had about 10 different therapists, 3 different rehabs and psychologists trying to fix myself but fuck me it was a hard and terrible road for everyone.) and I can finally see things clearly without the cloud of self loathing and hatred obscuring my vision. I haven't blacked out in months and it's been almost a year since I've had a major incident and that's because I met a wonderful girl (she's honestly one of the best and most pure person I've ever met, thinking of doing something that would hurt her finally knocked some sense into me, everytime I think I might potentially hurt her feels like a punch in my gut. She doesn't deserve it and honestly I don't even deserve her she's too good for me) and with the help of my family who never abandoned me and has always supported me especially my poor father. I must've aged him by an extra 10 years.

I haven't eaten or slept in 2 days because the full consequences and scope of my actions have finally dawned on me after I returned from one of the best weekends of my life with my girl without using drugs or alcohol which is the first time in my life that I've had that much fun sober or fucked up.
 I admit it I'm an asshole, I'm a self centered, self hating piece of fucking shit and I couldn't even see it until now. But that all changes today.

This realisation is very hard to process and it's really hard to not hate myself for everything I've done even with all the progress I've made since.

Since Ive been at university Ive used alcohol to get to sleep, which I think in lots of respects contributed to my psychotic episode last year. Since then my use of alcohol has spiralled, to a point where this weekend I had a bit of a breakdown and ended up in hospital after attempting to unlive. The doctors have said the best method for treatment is at home as Im not having any delusions, just a few auditory hallucinations. ive always been quite depressed so ive been feeling a bit hopeless about that ever changing. I was wondering if anyone could give some advice on how to continue without A:being intoxicated B:without the grand ideals which came with psychosis. I think have this really stupid god complex where i can only be content when life is extraordinary (e.g becoming a rockstar that makes people love eachother more, or an amazing relationship, or starting a revolution to dismantle capitalism, which in turn causes a much needed change in western culture). I know those examples are delusional but they aren’t delusions, they are just desires as I don’t believe any of those things would ever come true. I actually really liked being psychotic cause I at least believed they would come true, which brought me a lot of content. I think thats why I wanted to commit. Cause i dont want to keep working my ass off to feel no joy whatsoever. There is no meaning in working the 9 to 5 for the rest of my life to make someone else rich, when all i get back is social anxiety, depression and some money to pay for bills and booze.

I want to conclude by saying im not suicidal now, i want to get better, but i could use some help in finding out what kind of life i could live and how to deal with these frustrations.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37964,public,self,Problems with alcohol and living this life,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pwmp6n/problems_with_alcohol_and_living_this_life/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Hi everyone. So I met a very sweet woman at AA a few days ago. She’s been super helpful with bringing me to meetings, introducing me to people and encouraging me but I feel like she’s also using me to vent and unload. She started gossiping about others who attend the same meetings as us. She talks a million words per minute and it really makes my anxiety go through the roof and I feel like it’s really damaging to my sobriety. It’s literally the entire ride to and from meets. Not a second less.

I really love that she’s kind and wants to help me. That she sees me as a person she can trust and open up to. But I feel like it’s just so she can complain to me and unload her problems/past traumas. I still have my things that I am trying my best to deal with sober and am only 8 days into this. I’m scared that this may eventually lead to my demise. I’ve been trying so hard to practice mindfulness and stay positive. And I’ve been doing great otherwise. People at the meetings tell me to stick with her. And I’m scared that if I tell her I can’t go with her anymore or tell her why that she’ll either just show up where I live, start drama or spread rumors about me at the meets or who knows what else. I don’t want to be the one to potentially trigger a relapse either. I don’t want to hurt her feelings and I get she’s also going out of her way to help me but my sobriety needs to come first for me. And I’m way too new to sobriety to be handling other people’s traumas like this. She’s told me way too much about her in the last few days and I’m still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me. Is this selfish of me? I know there’s a step that says to help others and that the program only works if you help others but I feel like I need to help myself first….

Has anyone been in this situation before? What should I do? I don’t want to offend or hurt anyone. But I need to continue this path without my peace being broken.

While practicing service to others, if my successes give rise to grandiosity, I must reflect on what brought me to this point.  What has been given joyfully, with love, must be passed on without reservation and without expectation.  For as I grow, I find that no matter how much I give with love, I receive much more in spirit.

I’m a 26 year old woman and just had my first child in May. I remained sober my entire pregnancy for my son’s health but since giving birth, I’ve fallen right back into regular drinking. I’m a highly functional drunk, I’m capable of doing everything normally, speaking normally, and I never allow myself to breastfeed after more than the recommended limit of 1-2 glasses of wine. But once I breastfeed, I down a few more drinks to make the most of that time before I have to sober up again. (I do not endanger my son… for the most part, we bottle feed him). 

A few important notes: 

I and my husband both were raised by alcoholic mothers. I cared for my mother in my teenage years while she scream-cried for hours and pulled knives on me, slurred and stumbled, etc. My father gave up helping her, they separated and I was her caretaker. Then it was my baby brother when I left. She considers herself “well” now. And while she is happy and I enjoy being around her again, she very much is still a heavy drinker. 

I have attempted to quit before and I always manage to justify not continuing my streak. Usually it’s “I’ll only drink on the weekends” or “I’ll drink as much water as alcohol”, “I’ll only drink the seven drinks max limit”, etc. 

I am on heavy-ish medication. An anti-anxiety, an anti-depressant, and a beta blocker. 

I ALWAYS end up hating myself in the midst of drinking. Every. Fucking. Time. I get so pissed that I let myself drink as much as I did. Then once the headache goes away and I sleep it off, I manage to justify it all over again the next night. 

I saw a therapist for 5 years and she repeatedly told me she did not believe I had a problem, even though I regularly brought it up. She thinks I only feel out of control because I’m so scared to become my mother. 

But I never want to put my son through what I went through. I want to live a long, healthy life. Frankly, I’m terrified I’ve somehow already fucked up my body. 

I guess my question is this: how do you start, and HOW do you keep committed?

I'm particularly triggered lately because I'm thinking I need to rehome my dog. Every time I have gone to rehab, the hospital, or left town to help dying family, I have no one who can take proper care of him and I don't really know any services that are trustworthy. 

I get confused, frustrated, scared and sad whenever I think about anything like getting a job, having an apartment of my own, or trying to keep the program first.

Hi everyone. I wanted to create this account and join this community to connect with others on the same journey as myself. Sorry that it’s kind of long. 
        I’ve been struggling with alcohol addiction for the better part of 15 years. I’m 30 now. It originally started as a way to cope with being bullied in school, body shaming, childhood trauma, physical/mental abuse at home and from a teacher, rape, being taken by DCYF due to skipping school, and just never quite fitting in no matter how hard I tried. I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I ended up staying back in school for two years and dropped out in the 8th grade as soon as I turned 16. I kept most of these issues bottled up and picked up smoking cigarettes, self harm, drinking and smoking pot with my few friends who were also “outcasts.” I finally felt like I belonged since we all did the same thing to numb the pain.  
       When I turned 17, I got a fake ID and started dancing to make enough to move out of my abusive home. I got my own place and thought I was queen of the world. Well, unfortunately that job just glorified drinking and drugging and sent me down an even worse path. I stopped self harm and smoking pot/cigarette but the drinking got much worse as it was just handed to me… I’d pound down shots and put myself in risky situations.. But the money was incredible and since all my peers were doing it and my employer encouraged it, I felt like I belonged. I knew it was getting into a problem when even they fired me for getting too drunk… I lost friends who were “party people” themselves. Cause I just couldn’t hold my liquor cause I was all or nothing. Having an eating disorder while drinking probably didn’t help. 
Anyways, this went on for years. I traveled to get away and any time anyone called me out on being a sloppy drunk, I got defensive and figured they were the problem. I felt like the whole world was against me. That they were the problem. When in reality, if you think everyone around you has a problem, you’re more than likely THE problem yourself. The only people I clicked with were those who would enable me and laugh when I got drunk but still hang out again. The ones who wouldn’t judge me and would feed my addiction.
I got so bad that I’d go out on dates just so someone could buy me drinks and get me drunk… Even if I just “Irish goodbyed” them after.  I’ve been hospitalized many times from passing out at bars or in public.. But I wouldn’t say it was cause I got drunk. I’d insist that I didn’t drink that much and that somebody must’ve drugged my drink. I lied despite knowing the truth even when I was pronounced dead for 20 seconds. 
Nothing stopped me… I thought I was so sly hiding bottles, burying cans under the trash so it would look like I drank less. Thinking I was holding my composure when I was a drunken mess… 
After all of this, I still never thought my problem was a problem. Last year I attended my first AA meeting. But I compared instead of identified. I didn’t take it seriously and despite staying sober for 2 months, as soon as my bday came around I thought I was cured and that I can just have one or two and be fine. What a joke that was. Sure the first few times I was able to but then I was like well if I can have two then I can probably have 3 and be fine too. Ha. 
It got worse and worse. I denied having a problem cause it wasn’t daily. I’d just binge about twice per week. My poor fiancé would come home from work and see me a drunken mess. 
But something hit me and hit me hard like a ton of bricks about a week ago. If I don’t get help, I’m going to die alone. He’s going to leave me. I’ll be stuck in this toxic cycle. And I cried for days thinking about it. Almost got suicidal. But then something told me I can’t give up. I can’t lose faith. That I am a great person when I don’t abuse alcohol. That I need help. 
That is when I swore on everything that I WILL (not just try) quit. I want to feel alive and have a purpose. I want a bright future. To have a family. A happy home. Instead of building a life like the one I grew up with and around. I deserve better. My family deserves better (even if they tried to enable me), and my fiancé deserves better. 
I’ve been attending zoom meets daily as well as in person meets. I met a friend at AA who takes me to live meetings daily and is as eager about sobriety and helps encourage me. I try to speak at every meeting to get over the mental block and thought that I NEED alcohol for people to accept me and to talk to others. I got two chips that I carry everywhere as a reminder. I quit my bar tending job to avoid sabotage, keep a journal that I write in twice per day, I keep positive messages around the house, meditate and have been practicing mindfulness. I even went out with a group of people from AA to dinner yesterday. For the first time, the voice in the back of my head that tells me to drink was nowhere to be found. It was amazing. To be able to smile, laugh, talk freely and be myself without using alcohol as a crutch like I did for 15 years….. I know it’s just the beginning but I feel blessed.. I feel like I’m on a path to finally break free from everything I once knew. I’ll finally be able to grow and create a beautiful life….

While on the road to recovery I received a gift that could not be purchased.  It was a card from my son in college, saying, 'Dad, you can't imagine how glad I am that everything is okay.  Happy Birthday, I love you.'  My son had told me that he loved me before.  It had been during the previous Christmas holidays, when he had said to me, while crying, 'Dad, I love you!  Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?'  I couldn't.  Choked with emotion, I had cried, but this time, when I received my son's card, my tears were tears of joy, not desperation.

The amends is an opportunity for us to give to those from whom we have taken, for their sake! We come to this program powerless, meaning we had been relying on the delusion of personal power that we don't really have. No matter how hard we tried to exert personal power to manage our lives, we always ended up in the same place -- desperate and drunk with a path of wreckage behind us.

When we work this program of recovery with diligence, we get connected (or reconnected) to a higher power that fills us up and guides us, if we let it. I am very grateful that my higher power gave me words of truth to speak and filled me with love, compassion, understanding, and most importantly faith -- all of which I was able to give to my ex wife without the expectation of getting anything in return.

Friend (m39) has been drinking (not at alcoholic levels) since he was about 17. 

He was going through some personal things and spent the last 13 months drinking heavily and likely is an alcoholic. 

Drinking at 6:00 am until he passed out, waking up and drinking some more, and never skipping a day.

Mostly vodka. Between .75 and 1.25 pints per day on single drinking days, and about double that on days he would drink, sleep, then drink some more.

He was hiding it from his wife (or so he thought), and she finally confronted him a couple weeks ago. 

He knew she was right about him likely being an alcoholic, and he knew she was right about how it was affecting their relationship, his work, etc, so he quit cold turkey that day. 

It’s been two weeks. But here’s the thing, he feels fine. In fact he feels pretty damn great! If he went through withdrawals, they were minimal and short lived. And he doesn’t even crave it. He’s around other people drinking and will even cook with beer and wine still. 

I am certain he has not relapsed and hidden it (trust me) and I believe he feels the way he says he feels. 

So, if he could go from drinking the amount he did to not drinking at all, overnight, and without withdrawals or even cravings, do you think he’s really an alcoholic, or could he maybe have just settled into a shitty routine for the last year+ and simply needed to be snapped out of it?

Also, as I said, he feels great. He gained a lot of weight over the last year and was basically either drunk or hungover all the time. He has complained of stomach/abdomen discomfort and of feeling generally bad in the past, but he barely ate, barely slept, and drank liquor every day, so feeling like ass with stomach pains doesn’t sound too unusual, but he was a little concerned he may have done serious damage to his internal organs. 

Two weeks later though, and all the pain is gone and his appetite is back and he basically seems to be like he was 13 months ago only about 20 lbs heavier. 

Do you think he could have internal organ damage? 

He doesn’t like going to the doctor. 

Thanks!

TLDR: friend seemed to be a bad alcoholic for the last 13 months and then quit cold turkey. He seems completely fine. No withdrawal/cravings, and he feels great.

I really need some recommendations. Please scroll to the bottom if you don’t want to read my story. Thank you!

38 years old. I’ve been a heavy drinker for about 19 years. Two years ago I wound up in the hospital with double vision, no balance. I couldn’t walk, no alcohol in my system. I went through the all the tests (CT, ultrasound, EKG, etc.) Long story short, I was “severely malnourished,” my liver is in bad shape, and Wernicke-Korsicoff. 

Doctors said my inability to walk, due to brain damage, without assistance would likely be permanent. They released me after three days with a regimen  of supplements (thiamine, potassium, folic acid, and magnesium) and a $20k bill. 

I’ve been sober off and on since, but also felt like what’s the point. My vision is fine but my balance never came back. My speech is slurred which is ironically hilarious since I’m sober. I shake worse than I ever did during the worst withdrawals. I eat now, which is a change. I take supplements. But, I have failed to ever follow up since my hospital stay. I realize that should be my obvious first step. It’s to the point now where the tremors are so bad it’s difficult to eat, after three (new) months sober. (Stirring food/getting it to my mouth, picking up a cup.) I know going to a doctor is the obvious next step, same as it was 2 years ago after I was released from the hospital. I’ve scheduled and cancelled and feel frozen. Idk what im so afraid of; it certainly is not dying.

Does anyone have any recommendations for facilities that can help, not just with the addiction, but the health stuff? Maybe they all do, I have no idea. I barely sleep due to neuropathy, mostly in my feet, anxiety, depression, lack of alcohol. I can barely walk due to joint and nerve pain and lack of movement (work from home now.) The tremors, after months of sobriety, are so bad I can hardly use utensils to eat.

Any help is appreciated. I’ve been to some meetings but all zoom bc of Covid and lack of mobility. I’ve gained inspiration but never made an actual connection because since the hospital, I had to move to a new city to have help. I only know my best friend who helps with me and my dog… but she is an alcoholic too. 

Thank you all so much, and I look up to each and every one of you. If anyone wants to privately message me, I’d welcome that too. Very long story short.

my brother moved in with my wife and i when we got out of his second visit to rehab. he is 30, and very smart, shy but funny when we is in a good mood. it was really good, until it  wasnt. i guess the freedom that our house allowed with us all working let him slip up. this wasnt a huge deal at first. we got home from work and realized what had happened, we were not tooooo suprised but sad. we took his alcohol. i took the next day off of work so we could talk about things and set some more defined  boundaries. we chatted but wanted to wait until my wife got home, i took what stuff i could find from his room, and we went back to bed to rest from the day before. 

I was in the house and  he continued to drink. i guess he snuck out while i slept or something... i was just one room over and he wasnt able to step out and say anything. this is tearing me up. i know shame must be rooted to his core, believing he is disappointing us. and now i feel like it is my fault for trusting him in his room alone. my wife is throwing some shade.

he is back in rehab, thank god, but i am scared for him. if one of his only friends is just one room over and is unable to do anything how will he ever get out of this. it is getting so bad im scared that if he cannot reach out to me, or anyone, he will end up drinking himself to death. my parents told me some stories about how bad it can get for him and i feel like this is how it is going to end.

they tried setting hard boundaries but he ends up sneaking out and drinking during the night, or driving around, or just running away.

When you stop drinking,

People close to you will say things like, “I am proud of you”, “it takes courage and strength to admit you have a problem and to do something about it” “we’re still friends, we’ll still invite you to stuff and we’ll figure out stuff to do” “you’ll feel better soon, it gets better” “no shame in getting help”

It feels like bullshit. You feel alone, you feel left out. You feel like everyone you know now treats you different. The fun is gone and those closest to you will tell you to replace that void with lame shit, like cleaning or walking around aimlessly. “Find a new hobby”- well guess what all the things you used to do for fun, like golf, watching the big game, meeting up with friends, you can’t really do anymore because drinking was usually involved and now it just seems like a piece of it is missing. 

The boredom is bad, watching movies you’ve already seen just to pass the time. Going to bed early because you don’t know what else to do. I’ve never been one to claim the world resolves around me because it certainly doesn’t. All your friends will be nice to your face and say that they support you, but really that is to make themselves feel good. They all still go out (and I don’t blame them) and tell you all about their fun weekend trips, going to the new brewery, nights out and adventures come Monday morning and then realize “oh shit he probably doesn’t want to hear this and then just awkwardly look at their shoes without even you having to say anything. 

Your family, girlfriend, friends, doctor, social worker, coworkers anyone who knows will instinctively look at you different. Some because they actually care and some because they don’t know what else to do. You will lose friends, and it will all happen all at once. All you want is to go back the way it was but it can never truly go back even if you go ahead and pick up the bottle just to numb the pain.

It seems to get worse with every new person you have to tell “I can’t go out tonight” for no good reason and you feel like some outcast, to people who know you the best.

Some of us have taken very hard knocks to learn this truth: Job or no job – wife or no wife – we simply do not stop drinking so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence on God.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 98

Before coming to A.A., I always had excuses for taking a drink: 'She said...', 'He said...', 'I got fired yesterday', 'I got a great job today'.  No area of my life could be good if I drank again.  In sobriety my life gets better each day.  I must always remember not to drink, to trust God, and to stay active in A.A.  Am I putting anything before my sobriety, God, and A.A. today?

Riding through the park and the surrounding neighborhoods, marveling at the live oaks, I thought back to my early struggles with this whole God/Higher Power business.

The live oaks are magnificent. Each one entirely unique in composition, but within a family. There is one little section in the park with about a dozen trees and there is very clearly a grandpa live oak, a grandma live oak and all their children and grandchildren.

There is something about them that is awe-inspiring in a quiet way.

When I washed into AA, I had a lot of very fancy ideas and complicated beliefs about God, religion, theology, spirituality and all that biz. It all rolled around in my head, generally keeping me agitated and confused.

The book says *“We found that as soon as we were able to* ***lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe*** *in a power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that power, which is God.""*

*“lay aside prejudice”.*  You mean, put down what *I think I know* about God, religion, theology, spirituality and all that biz? Admit that I don’t have all the answers?

*“a willingness to believe”.*  Maybe *try something different for a change*? I mean, my best thinking and selfish actions are what landed me here in the first place.

And as I was riding, it hit me: I can’t make a live oak. I can plant a seed or sapling, water it, nurture it, protect it and watch it grow, but I’m not responsible for what brings a live oak to life. That power is beyond me. 

That is a humbling epiphany. 

Today, I don’t know anything about God, and I have realized that for me, wherever my higher power resides or whatever it really is, isn’t important. It simply doesn’t matter. 

I have come to believe through my lived experience that my higher power doesn’t care about who I believe in, how I think, or what my feelings on the subject are, but it does care very much about my actions - how I treat myself and others.

However, I recently scored a position in my old career which required me to move interstate.

I thought I'd be okay. However, I found the process of moving so traumatic that I feel like I'm a completely different person now on a completely different planet. I'm scared of everything and can see or feel no joy or hope anywhere.

I'm currently staying with a family member before I'm allowed to fly interstate, and I'm struggling so damn hard to stay alive.

Why you may ask? Because I was struck utmost myself from what I did last Friday that it was simply easy. Last Friday I drank from 5 pm to 8 pm Saturday -- yes that's right. And now after all that progress it has lured me back in. It is 2:40 am where I am and I don't feel myself ever wanting to stop. I had a great day because of my sober week. I did a lot of my work, studied, and even got a new tattoo. Now though at 2:40 I just want to take my electric bike out and ride around. 

Meanwhile my wife is in the other room sleeping hoping to God I can just keep it together for once. I promised her I'd turn it all around once we got married and bought this house... But yet here I am, it seems as thing get better I just thrive off it and take it into my own selfish labyrinth of drinking myself into a false state but yet continually stuck in the mode that I desperately starve for. Despite my goals and how I want things to be I always rock into this mode. I'm an engineer and have dozens of ideas that investors would fight over but yet I'd rather drown in my own pity. But then again I guess that is what happens when you grew up as someone everyone expected to be in prison. My mother was bipolar and God knows I feel the mania and Satan knows I feel the depression because it has nearly taken my life. 

In a nutshell I'm the type of drinker that when I start I can't stop. I can't stop so badly that I don't ever even go to sleep because I drink beer. I'll stay up 48 hrs. drinking on the weekend without sleep just drinking. I seem to just ride a high like a bipolar person on a manic trip. But yet 3 or 4 of the days of the week I'm cool and happy not drinking. But normally that is all because I'm still ruminating on how my last drunk totally kicked my ass. It just seems to me that this drink puts a spell over me and I can't get over it, I just can't beat the damn thing, no matter how fucking hard I try I just keep trying and trying. I know I'll quit when I have to but damn it is really kicking the shit out of me. 

My father was an alcoholic and it lead/contributed in my parents divorce when I was 13. Later on when I was 18 he died. He buried himself in a studio apartment after the divorce drinking himself to death with a strange hint of pride. I live in that apartment with him when my mom kicked me out at 16. My grandfather died at a local bar, he was a local and had a heart attack at 56 one night. My dad's brother (my uncle John) died drinking Listerine, my uncle Bill (my dads brother too) was a wild drunk but an awesome man. Bill ended up dying of all kinds of health complications. My half brother Tony died of a heroine overdose last year at 34. My cousin Eric died this year and was a meth addict. 

Sure that might be me feeling sorry for myself? But it is my fucking reality. I don't know where to turn. I'm a strong and established 27 year old man but both parents are dead, all grandparents, siblings live out of state, and I don't even wat to think of that as an excuse.

We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again: 'Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.'  Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever.  If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 33

Today I am an alcoholic.  Tomorrow will be no different.  My alcoholism lives within me now and forever.  I must never forget what I am.  Alcohol will surely kill me if I fail to recognize and acknowledge my disease on a daily basis.  I am not playing a game in which a loss is a temporary setback.  I am dealing with my disease, for which there is no cure, only daily acceptance and vigilance.

I was always the life of the party in high school, the first time I had ever got drunk, I don’t know how to describe it really other than I felt wholesome? I fell in love with how I felt. Through high school whenever there were parties, or even just going to a friends house for the night all I wanted to do and all I really cared about was getting drunk. Looking back on it my friends would get drunk to just enhance the night a little more, but when i would get drunk it was a little more personal, I didn’t really want to do it just for the fun of it. I just wanted the sensation and that was all. Fast forward to when I was 18/19 years old I had got out of high school and had gone through a trade school, I started working in my profession and I remember I was going through a bit of a rough patch mentally, I was just miserable, I was severely depressed and I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch to get me through and as time had progressed I never really noticed how far I getting into it before I was drinking every night, I would drink bourbon in my room by myself every night whether I had to wake up for work at 5am or not. And not only did the frequency of my drinking increase but so did my depression, I had gotten to the point that I just didn’t want to be alive anymore. I felt like I had nothing to lose and had completely accepted defeat and was embracing my alcoholism. Not only was I drinking every night but I had also began skipping work to get drunk, I would leave work early to go home and drink. I would drive to work drunk. I was hell bent on staying mentally absent. I began taking whatever people would offer. I’d smoke weed, I would drink lean, someone would give me adderall at work here and there. It had gotten to a point where I was in so much trouble with my job because of my spotty attendance that one night I decided that I needed to get better so I broke the news to my family they were supportive, they gave me help. I was seeing a psychologist and an addiction specialist, the psychologist wrote me some prescriptions for my depression and anxiety and that’s when I fell head over heels for Xanax. I began abusing those and to skip ahead, at my worst I was going through 60 pills in about two weeks time. I made it through, I got myself out of it.

He [Bill W.] said to me, gently and simply, 'Do you think that you are one of us?'

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 413 (Third Edition)

During my drinking life I was convinced I was an exception.  I thought I was beyond petty requirements and had the right to be excused.  I never realized that the dark counterbalance of my attitude was the constant feeling that I did not 'belong.'  At first, in A.A., I identified with others only as an alcoholic.  What a wonderful awakening for me it has been to realize that, if human beings were doing the best they could, then so was I!  All of the pains, confusions and joys they feel are not exceptional, but part of my life, just as much as anybody's.

I should be happy. 

But this isn’t my first time around - I had almost a year once before and then relapsed, and I was out for six years. During those six years I did irreparable damage to my marriage and children. I’m glad I’m sober now, but I am struggling to come to terms with the fact that I lost so much time with my children - who are just about grown now - and the fact that I hurt my husband so badly he wants to leave me now. 

Ive gone through the steps with a good sponsor. I’ve done my best to make amends but there are some things that can’t be fixed. I can never make it up to my children that they grew up in an alcoholic home with an alcoholic mother. My husband can never unhear the cruel things I said to him while drunk. I’ve just done too much damage to my marriage that it is no longer reparable and it’s killing me. 

I feel like an unloveable monster. Im not a monster - I know that. The things I did were all pretty run of the mill alcoholic stuff - I threw temper tantrums, I said mean things while drunk, I was not present for my kids the way they deserved. I didn’t hit anyone or be physically abusive (yet). But what I did was enough to kill my marriage and leave my children with lifelong scars. 

On the day of my last drunk my husband said he was done and wanted to divorce. I convinced him to give me six months to show him I was serious. At six months he said he was unsure, so we gave it another six months. Now he says he loves me but he doesn’t want to live with me anymore. 

This year has been a good one in our marriage. I’ve gotten some emotional sobriety and I don’t rave and rant anymore, and I can handle disagreement without fighting. We have been kind and loving to each other, and I thought we were going to be okay. But we arent. 

Ive spent 24 years with this man and we’ve raised three children. I thought we’d be old together.

I've had sponsors, home groups, did some service work, met some amazing people, but I just can't grasp what keeps everyone walking that walk. I keep being told that I am going to hear something that will just click, but it doesn't happen. When someone speaks I listen and have heard some good stuff, but again nothing is clicking. I feel like I'm going crazy between my parents having been convincing me since I was young that I'm not normal and fucked up and me knowing what's really going on in my head, but trying to appease them while at the same time, trying to apply myself to the program in it's entirety.

“That when all other measures fail work with another alcoholic would save the day”

I have been praying a lot for God to remove my fear and direct my attention to what he would have me be and then finding myself looking for ways to work with others and finding that the fear would dissipate.
One way that I like to work with others is reading the big book with them, I am reading the big book with another alcoholic at the moment we read a page at a time and then discussing our findings. Works a treat.

So I have felt for some time I’ve had a problem with alcohol. For years I even joked about it, saying “it’s only beer, real alcoholics drink the strong stuff”. I’m realising that I’ve been convincing myself I’m ok when in fact I’m not.

I don’t drink every day… but probably every other day. I can’t remember when I started drinking like this but a few years ago I got into some legal trouble and it’s dragged on and on. My anxiety was and very much is through the roof. Beer just calmed my nerves. 

Skip forward to now and the last few months have been absolute psychological torture. I’ve had to make a phone call every day for 8 weeks to my solicitor to see if I’m being called to court the next day. I split with my wife. I lost my job. My car is in a state of disrepair and I can’t afford to fix it. I rarely get to see my 1 year old son. I’ve had to move back in with my parents. Honestly, it’s a wonder it’s only alcohol I turned to. Believe me I considered suicide many many times. Even tried but chickened out. I don’t have the stones for it. Too much of a coward.

But you know what, alcohol was always there for me. It would change my mood around, it would relax me. I felt almost ethereal when drunk because I wouldn’t be anxious, the weight was lifted. It made me stop thinking about taking my own life.

But it was only temporary. 

I’m at the end of my legal battle (or at least this one for now) and I want to mend my ways. I don’t know whether I should just try and cut down or give it up completely. I always maintained I drink for a reason - and that reason is to get drunk. I see no other point in drinking unless I’m gonna get wasted.

Tomorrow is my birthday and I want to spend it sober. Tomorrow is also the day I’m in court, the day I told myself I’d drink to celebrate the end of this whole charade. But I don’t want to. 

I haven’t had a drink today but I’ve been hung over the whole time.

As I was standing in the processing line, the fun part of feet on the feet, spread, squat, thank you next I remember someone saying, ""now is the time and keep an open mind.""  

It has not always been fun.  Life doesn't give me a break.  Sometimes the sun doesn't shine.

We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The last Promise in the Big Book came true for me on the very first day of sobriety.  God kept me sober that day, and on every other day I allowed Him to operate in my life.  He gives me the strength, courage and guidance to meet my responsibilities in life so that I am then able to reach out and help others stay sober and grow.  He manifests within me, making me a channel of His word, thought and deed. He works with my inner self, while I produce in the outer world, for He will not do for me what I can do for myself.  I must be willing to do His work, so that He can function through me successfully.

Though, if you think that my intentions are to uphieve or hinder what ever it is you got going on in there.. I recommend you reconsider how you view me and know that, regardless of what may have happened, I am loyal to the fact that this place and why I am here is to have some time to spend with sobriety being the environment and/or similar to symbolism, how a church is known to be the House of God.

The fact that I hold what is the combination to the keys for entry and the efforts to prevent me inside can only suggest one of two things, if not both.

• The place, which has not been a self sufficient orginazation for some time now, has been inhabited by individuals without the concern of a fellow alcoholic and/or has not been addressed to what the facility facilitates currently.

• Second being, the emotions in which you have towards myself, who I am and what I represent is an act against my survival (in the idea that I am a real alcoholic) because of the inability to be civilized, own to what you've done and understand that I have given forgiveness and attend these rooms without any intent to cause harm.

• Justifying, though how accurate I'm unsure of, the probability in which the things I have to say and know to be the Truth are related to this facility and/or the people within. It would be in your best interest, to been seen in good light of the situation, to not necessarily have a welcoming of sorts but most certainly, the opportunity to enter without nefarious activities going on or intended to get me involved.

I don't put blame to why you might be acting the way you are. Believe it or not, a bit of practical reasoning to the behavior expressed and an understanding. Though, it does not justify what is actually going on and the prevention of an alcoholic with the desire to stop drinking.

Should there be an individual, if not all 5 of whom should be in my presence and not necessarily for my own sake, though I would appreciate the notion, but again - to be seen in good light, despite what's happened. I would highly recommend the release of all 5 women and upon the situation in where you find negotiating to be intelligent or logical, find the common sense in whom you send.

I started drinking about ten years ago. I never really messed with it much until I turned 21. I started drinking whiskey. I'd have a couple of drinks to wind down. And then a couple of drinks eventually turned into the whole bottle. Im a big guy and I feel like I need to emphasize that now. It got to the point to where I was drinking a fifth every day. I got sick once (not alcohol related) and went to the doctor and they discovered that my liver enzymes were elevated (obviously). They told me to stop drinking. I didn't. I did ease myself off the liquor and switched to beer. And that was fine for awhile. But then I started drinking way too much of that too. I was drunk everyday until I lost my job because I'd get hammered the night before I had to be there and didn't go. I tried to cut back. Im no longer drunk every night, but on the nights I do get drunk, I'm drinking either strong alcohol or I'm drinking well over a case of beer in a sitting. It's not good. I know it's going to kill me if I don't stop, but I honestly don't think I can. No matter what kind of trouble it causes in my life and no matter the friction it causes in my relationships, I can't seem to stop. I dont physically crave it. It's definitely more mental for me. I'm bipolar and I try to tell myself that I drink because of that. But thsts bullshit. I tell myself I drink because of my anxiety. And sometimes that's the truth. The problem is that I don't stop drinking after the anxiety has gone away. I keep going until I pass out and sometimes I pass out in embarrassing places like a frat boy. I'm middle-aged. I feel anxious when I don't have any alcohol. And the time has come for me to finally admit that this problem isn't going to go away on its own. So Im just looking for advice. I can't afford rehab. What can I do? For the record, I'm not on drugs and don't plan to do any. But I need something to replace the alcohol. It doesn't have to offer the buzz. I just need a placeholder, you know?

I'd drink, and if I got drunk, I'd become more accentuated in my actions- I'd be louder, I'd be raunchier, I'd curse more etc and people would get offended and I'd feel like shit thinking that it was because of my drinking. 

Turns out, my ""friends"" were actually snakes in my garden manipulating me into feeling anxious and guilt over my actions and they'd blame the liquor and call me an alcoholic. I thought the issue was the alcohol. 

Turns out, now that I've been working on myself and opened my eyes to see the true issue- I was addicted to punishing myself, which would cause me to drink. Now that I've recognized that, my drinking has *significantly* deceased, I dont black out anymore, I dont get drunk but more so a tipsy, and if at a party maybe a little bit more than tipsy but I know can easily stop and switch to water. 

I never was the type drink everyday but when I did drink it would be in excess. 

I guess after years of binge drinking I've finally found the light at the end and no longer feel a prisoner to the heavy drinking. 

Moral of the story, I let people make me believe I had an addiction to alcohol when I actually had an addiction to blaming myself and punishing myself indefinitely, thankfully after removing the toxic manipulators in my circle I realize that I don't.

We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The last Promise in the Big Book came true for me on the very first day of sobriety.  God kept me sober that day, and on every other day I allowed Him to operate in my life.  He gives me the strength, courage and guidance to meet my responsibilities in life so that I am then able to reach out and help others stay sober and grow.  He manifests within me, making me a channel of His word, thought and deed. He works with my inner self, while I produce in the outer world, for He will not do for me what I can do for myself.  I must be willing to do His work, so that He can function through me successfully.

It's a Discord group chat with so many people like us. There are text meetings at every other hour as well as voice meetings. There's also a general chat room to hop onto when you're feeling in need of support but there's no meeting available yet. It's a great way to get easy access to our AA community. I strongly encourage anyone who may need this -- especially for those who are too nervous to go to a face-to-face meeting. There are also resources for sponsors as well if you don't have one yet.

I have gotten to the point where I always ask her to please not drink too much anytime we decide we’re going out (Because, not drinking in a social environment isn’t really a thing for us). 

The thing is she doesn’t know her limit. She always tries to drink as much as everyone else but once she gets to that point where she’s drunk it’s like her brain completely shuts off.

This has been an issue for years and I’ve tried many things like 75 hard which includes 75 days of being sober and doing other productive things to build metal toughness. 
We got to day 52 and lost and decided to try again in the future. 
That little break didn’t work. She went maybe two weeks being able to control her drinking when we go out because she knew how big of a deal it was for me to see her control herself but after she passed the limit one time she completely fell back into that same person who doesn’t stop drinking until she’s back at home in her bed. 

This has gotten so bad that every time we go on trips I can’t have a good time because she gets that drunk and I have to make sure she’s not falling over and to be honest it’s embarrassing that my fiancé acts like that. We fight about this all the time but she doesn’t think it’s a big deal. 

(Also just btw I literally have ptsd when I dream because of the embarrassment she causes me when we go out.)

Looking back I know realize how much pain and suffering that has caused me and recently it happened again where she gets too drunk and it ruined a night out with my coworker and his wife. My fiancé got too drunk and embarrassed herself again. Right before she got too fucked up I told to please not drink anymore or order anymore drinks because she’s getting to THAT point and I told her I would be done with the relationship if she didn’t stop. 
she grabbed the pitcher that was at the table when I was playing pool with my coworker and had another beer and got even more fucked up. Till now she doesn’t think she did anything wrong. She has told me that she hates when she gets like that but she isn’t doing anything to stop it. I honestly feel like she might still be in denial about how she really gets but just tells me what I want to hear.

I’ve come to realize she isn’t taking into consideration how it makes me feel when she gets like that. All she thinks about is her next drink. She also makes me look like the bad guy for trying to get her to stop drinking before she gets too messed up. Idk sorry if this was too long but I really love her and would love some advice on how to help. Thanks in advance 🙏🏽

Oh also one more thing.. ‼️ her dad is a huge alcoholic and her older sister is also a very bad drunk. She HATES when they drink, probably for the same exact reason I hate when she drinks..

I never considered myself an alcoholic and I'm not sure whether I do now. I know I have a bad relationship with alcohol.

I'm 31 and felt like I've struggled with alcohol for almost 10 years. I've been able to function for the most part. Successful job, relationship, good friends. But often have drunk alone, felt like I wanted to drink more or quicker than the people around me and always would sneak drinks or deliberatelyom pour myself stronger ones. I've not had any serious repercussions other than some severe hangovers and embarrassment.

Over the last 5years I've quit 3 times and before that I couldn't remember a time I'd gone longer than 1 week without drinking since I was 18. The last time I quit was because I drank like I had a death wish or something. Its hard to explain but although it was a weeknight and I knew I would feel horrible the next day I just kept drinking. Low and behold I woke up at 3am with terrible anxiety and after a hellish day or so recovering I stopped.

I didn't stop thinking 'I'm an alcoholic' and I didnt attend AA or anything.

Long story short, my partner went on a business trip this week and I found myself thinking I could go and buy some alcohol and get drunk while he's away and I've been thinking recently, maybe now I've gone so long without alcohol I could try it again. The problem is the last couple of times I've done that I just slip back into the bad habits and eventually my body and mind can't handle it anymore.

I don't want to label myself an alcoholic because I don't know if I really am. If I can go so long without drinking and could do it without AA or rehab, maybe I'm just over exaggerating.

Alcohol snuck up on me. My father was a severe alcoholic my entire childhood until he quit when I was 18. I started drinking “socially” when I was 14 and always struggled with knowing when to stop, but only drank a couple of times per month (if that) when I went out to parties with friends. 

Alcohol had never been an issue for me, other than a few blackout nights here and there during my high school years. Skip forward a few years. I didn’t begin drinking frequently (2-4 times weekly) until October of 2019. I was just getting over a severe injury and was unable to walk for 4 months. Around this time is when I also got into a relationship with my first serious boyfriend. He previously struggled with benzo addiction and had been clean for a few months before we began dating. He remained clean our entire relationship and it was never an issue, but drinking was. He drank 4-5 nights per week and after a rough night would wake up and start drinking straight away. 

Already having some struggles with knowing when to stop, I slowly but surely picked up on these bad habits and before I knew it was drinking significantly more than him. I was “functioning”, never lost my job, didn’t get in any trouble with the law, etc. From the outside you would have never known, but close friends and family knew there was something going on. 

Eventually our relationship came to and end and I knew my drinking had to as well. After a couple of relapses I successfully quit drinking in late February. I didn’t drink for five months. During this time I grew and changed a LOT as a person. My entire perspective on alcohol (and life tbh) changed. This entire time I’ve been working with a therapist and she’s been great. For a while I thought I would never drink again, but my feelings slowly changed on that. I hated having this thing in my life that I wasn’t in control of, and having this strict rules on myself. I felt like my entire life revolved around not drinking, and I felt like I couldn’t enjoy my 20s having such a strict mentality. I wished so badly that I could join my friends going to wineries, going out on the weekends, etc. I tried hard to find other sober friends in my area in their early 20s but was unsuccessful. 

I decided I wanted to try drinking again, this time with balance. I started drinking again in august with intentions to just drink when I’m going out with friends. I don’t have any desire to get home from work and drink, drink alone, etc. I just simply want to be able to live my life, let loose here and there, and enjoy weekend drinks with friends. My therapist is on board with this. So far I’ve been successful, however the past couple of weekends I’ve consecutively gone out and I’ve had a hard time knowing when to stop. Nothing bad happened, but it really scared me. It makes me think that this is something I might not be able to have in my life and control. 

I don’t know what to do, do I chalk it up to being a hiccup and continue on with my life? Or is alcohol something I can’t have? I’m sorry this is so long.

AS GUIDE

See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come to pass for you and countless others.  This is the Great Fact for us.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 164

Having a right relationship with God seemed to be an impossible order.  My chaotic past had left me filled with guilt and remorse and I wondered how this 'God business' could work.  A.A. told me that I must turn my will and my life over to the care of God, as I understand Him.  With nowhere else to turn, I went down on my knees and cried, 'God, I can't do this. Please help me!'  It was when I admitted my powerlessness that a glimmer of light began to touch my soul, and then a willingness emerged to let God control my life.  With Him as my guide, great events began to happen, and I found the beginning of sobriety.

My brother has alcoholism and I remember during one episode during an extended family vacation he had too much to drink (which happens at least once a vacation), and my dad's mom had asked our family not to drink anymore alcohol anymore, so not to enable him. I said I would and didn't for the rest of the vacation, but my dad fought me and got belligerent when he'd secretly drink behind his mother's back after telling her he would respect that wish - ""I can drink whenever I want to"" was what he said, and although he said he can ""live without alcohol"", he wouldn't give it up. Even at home, he promised he'd drink less, but he cracks open a beer as soon as he gets home.

Is this normal? I just graduated from college (a party-heavy college, mind you) and I remember drinking only on the weekends and for special occasions.

I come from a family where heavy drinking is prevalent. My grandfather uncle and father have all struggled with alcoholism. None of them were able to “overcome” it. 
I want to find a way to not rely on drinking as a coping mechanism but have no idea where to start. 
I’ve tried therapy on and off for 5 years for different issues but I’m not the “therapy type of person”. Therapy truly works for some people but I’ve found no progress in it.
I’m currently looking up AA meetings in my area, but there’s so many to choose from. I suppose that’s a good problem to have. 
Is finding aa meetings a good place to start? How do I find the right place with so many options? How do I get a sponsor? Are there red flags I should look out for pertaining to staying sober?

Don't want to offend anyone. I'm just not sure where or from who I should ask these questions -so here I am. 

My situation is that I don't really -need- to drink at all. Usually I'm not experiencing any kind of an urge when it comes to consuming alcohol.
I could spend months without even thinking about a beer, but the problematic part of the story is that when I nevertheless open that one bottle of wine (oftentimes I do that because I'm bored and someone proposes to do so and I go like &gt;why not) I just CAN'T stop drinking. 

The one fine glass of wine is never enough for me.
I always want to grab an another one, and another, and another etc. 
Sometimes I can get hooked in getting drunk, and in that case the drinking can last for several weeks. 
After all, I always find something 'more fun to do' after the experienced intensive boozing period and somehow just -forget- that I've ever even liked alcohol. 


So what do you think? Should I try to reach help, or am I even experiencing a -drinking- problem at all? Something in my behaviour is a little bit fucked up for sure (also my friends &amp;family have expressed their concern about my consumption)

I started drinking a little over 6 months ago. It started as an occasional drink here and there to destress after work. Usually never drinking more than 2-3 days out of a month and most often not even half a wine cooler. 

I'm on sertraline (generic Zoloft; depression/anxiety) and haven't been taking it for the past month or so and it feels like I'm going downhill here. I'm to the point where I'm drinking everyday (damn near all day) just to keep myself from lashing out or breaking down. 

The thing I'm most worried about is the fact that this is putting my job at risk. I work fast food.. you know - always working with either meat slicers, knives, fryers, or cleaning supplies. All of which you probably shouldn't do unless you're sober. I recently got my job back with the company after a month away (ended up quitting; unrelated situation but tldr our new store manager was a big jerk). I really want to stop before I make some terrible, life altering mistake, but I feel like I can't. 
I have tried to stop on my own before by just pouring it all out, but ended up crying and buying more 2 days later. I'm scared I won't be able to stop. I hate that I started knowing that alcoholism has run very strong in my family and I feel like I'm breaking my boyfriend's heart. (He lost both parents + a step parent to alcohol.)

We admitted we couldn't lick alcohol with our own remaining resources, and so we accepted the further fact that dependence upon a Higher Power (if only our A.A. group) could do this hitherto impossible job.  The moment we were able to accept these facts fully, our release from the alcohol compulsion had begun.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 109

Freedom came to me only with my acceptance that I could turn my will and my life over to the care of my Higher Power, whom I call God.  Serenity seeped into the chaos of my life when I accepted that what I was going through was life, and that God would help me through my difficulties - and much more, as well.  Since then He has helped me through all of my difficulties!  When I accept situations as they are, not as I wish them to be, then I can begin to grow and have serenity and peace of mind.

It’s worth noting that sober I told all 3 of them they deserved this trip and should have fun. Well, his friends heard me yelling, and I actually caused them to miss a dinner reservation to a restaurant they were really excited to try. After not remembering any of this I decided to finally reckon with my binge drinking problem and get some help. Me and my partner were not fine at first. He damn near left me. But we are okay now. My shame and guilt are not. I have since apologized to both of his friends (since he wanted to bring them around the apartment and I felt I needed to say something) one of them has responded to my apology, but the other has completely ignored me. She is inviting my partner to hang out without me when normally I would be invited along and hasn’t said a word to him about me apologizing either. I know amends is the fourth step and I’m still working on step one, but I feel so guilty and as though his friend has now completely written me off because of this (she is the one that planned the trip.) these are my partners two best friends and I’m finding it extremely hard to forgive myself.

I worked at a liquor store from the time that I was 20-22 which allowed me to get started on this type of abuse; and my parents also have struggled with alcohol and other types of substance abuse.

Since I have started drinking alcohol heavily I have noticed the sharp decline in my health, happiness,  motivation and relationship. I am slowly deteriorating and seek help. I realize I have a problem but don't know how and where to start. I am about to graduate college with a BS in finance; however I recently have lacked the motivation to finish my degree even though I am a mere 12 units from graduating and I fear this is due to my alcoholism.

I am seeking any help from those who have overcome alcoholism. I have tried to quit and ditch the habit, but have been unsuccessful. In my mind I always find a scapegoat or reasons not to ""retire"" my drinking habit. I know it is limiting my potential, interfering with my social interactions, and relationship which is why I'm searching for ways to veer from my current path.

Sometimes I'm able to go a full week without drinking but only under certain circumstances. The rest of the time I end up waking up hungover and unable to fulfil my responsibilities which I have many. I also suffer from social anxiety which doesn't help.

I have a really strong will, meaning that if I want to do something I do it. I think that’s been the only thing saving me somewhat all this time, but am seriously worried I might have an addiction gene and alcohol will catch up with me.

Im seriously starting to think I might have an alcohol problem. If I am not actively not drinking, I can have times when I’m drinking half a bottle of vodka a day.

I noticed I drink to much 5 years ago and completely stopped. I didn’t have any alcohol for 5 years until June this year. Now I’m excessively drinking again, and it will take a massive effort to decide to completely stop again. I basically started because of the Covid mandates and all that’s happening right now.

I've just come out of a very codependent relationship with an addict who I met on Grindr, a platform I've been using since 2014 to hook up with people. I've always been horny, and there's no problem with that. The problem arose when I started to use sex as a proxy for emotional intimacy and connection when the pandemic started (or even before that), and my relationship has traumatized me to the point that I now have to treat Grindr as if it were a drink. It's not good for me because it may give me the illusion of intimacy and connection but will only harm me more when I'm done and the other person walks away; it's literally destroying my life but I do not know how to stop it.

I'm having horrible withdrawal symptoms and am struggling so hard right now not to download the damn thing and sleep with another man for tonight, I cannot handle sleeping by myself on weekends after my last relationship tbh. Imagining my addict ex enjoying orgies while high and drinking while I'm here literally shaking just makes me want to do the same for fuck's sake.

It has brought me to the point of exposing myself to STIs, exposing myself to probably dangerous people, separating myself from my family, losing myself in the long run because I do not know how to keep healthy relationships, giving me obsessive episodes and making me violent and irascible.

My sponsor called me today and said someone was asking if I could be the speaker at the weekly speaker meeting of her home group. I thought you could only do this after a year, but apparently it’s any milestone, and I just passed my ninety days. 

I was terrified. I told her I could maybe talk for 5-10 minutes, but not a whole hour. She asked if I thought I could do half an hour. I asked what I would even talk about, and she said just my story. I told her that shit is none of that room’s business. 

I recently turned down chairing a meeting at that group as well, since it was a Tuesday and I go to a once weekly group that only meets on Tuesdays. I’ve been told I should be saying “yes” more when I’m asked to be of service. I said I’d be willing to chair meetings, but I’m not ready to talk about myself like that. I’m told that it shouldn’t be that big a deal because I’ve been talking in the room for months now, but not like people do at speaker meetings! I’m not about to tell that whole room of over fifty people about my childhood and why I drank the way I drank, and all the shit that happened with that. 

What’s everyone’s thoughts on this? Is it typically “required” to have to be a speaker at a meeting, at some point in your AA recovery journey? Am I doing my recovery a disservice?

I didn’t work the program. I have nothing against it, I was just scared I guess. I went to a few meetings, I got a sponsor, but I wasn’t ready and I wasn’t going to waste anyone’s time. Next thing you know, one week turned into one month and then a year and now two. It just kind of happened like that. I like to think we all end up in the same place, no matter the path taken. This my journey. 

Now that that’s out of the way. 

**My names Eric and I’m an alcoholic.** 

I was a social drinker, then an every weekend drinker, then an every night drinker and then just a flat out drunk. Wake up, grab a pull of whatever I had to take the edge off, and start my day. Drink before work. Drink at work. At some point or another it became routine maintenance. I had become an alcoholic and my life was anything but manageable. It all seemed to happen so fast. When did this happen? 

I knew at a younger age I was going to have to stop drinking. I just knew it. I’m a very obsessive person. I don’t really do many things half ass, drinking included. “Oh, a shot? Give me the bottle. I’m 100% all in and 100 mph in which never direction chooses me. 

In my twenties I did the thing. You know, single, hung out with my friends and avoided anything that could be permanent or make me change (a relationship). I finished college and started doing what I wanted to do, I went to acting classes. I wanted to be Marlon Brando. I still do. Acting was my obsession at the time and alcohol was something I had a decent control over. 

But at some point, the alcohol took over. 

When I first moved to L.A. a co-worker of mine mentioned a story about a guy. This guy was so talented but he drank a thirty pack a day. So, he never got to be an actor. It wasn’t until I had a handle of whisky in my bedroom, I started to think “wait, am I becoming that guy? No way. You’re a struggling actor. You’re an artist. Be tortured, throw your inhibitions away and write like Hemingway, Miller or Williams. There’s no way you’ll die like them.” 

I was malicious. I was angry. I was misunderstood. I had a chip on my shoulder the size of a fifth of vodka.

I moved back to St. Louis. At the time people thought it was because I was homesick, nah, I went where the party was. I felt like I was missing out. John Goodman has this great interview where he talks about how alcohol was one of the main deciding factors on him moving to New Orleans. He wanted to be where the alcohol was. Alcoholic's have one thing in common, they all think alike. 

After a year or so of spoiling my liver and falling deeper and deeper into my alcoholism, the party suddenly ended. I met a girl. Now, the secrets out. There’s another person who knows how much I drink. She gets a front row seat to my one man show. I am now slowly becoming more and more aware of this lifestyle, that is slowly swallowing me whole and becoming my number one priority.  Everything else that I loved or had a passion for took the back seat to my daily habit. 

She was a drinker as well. Her and I used to drink every night. So in love, talking in circles, only to end up right back where we started. I wouldn’t trade those times for the world, but sometimes it feels like those were two completely different people back then.  Her family was more open about the program and being an alcoholic. I thought it was weird. I knew everything. Don’t over communicate it, don’t dissect it, just don’t. I’m a man. Yeah. 

A little over a year in, she decided to get sober. She went to 7 meetings a week, worked the steps, got a new job, did her passion stuff on the side, started getting more fit, laughing more, she was flat out flourishing. Then there’s me, angry as hell in the passenger seat whining about how my mom doesn’t love me. Then there’s me, complaining about how I look physically. Then there’s me, ranting for three minutes straight, blacking out in between, only to come to when everyone is looking at me like I have five fu\*kin’ heads. 

She never pressured me or gave me any ultimatums.  She knew this was hard, but being in a relationship with two people is hard as well. Dialogue was had frequently and I, like most alcoholics, get angry when the dialogue is centered around my drinking.  So I do what most alcoholics do in this situation, I took offense. “You don’t think I can do it? Okay."" So I’d quit. I’d go three weeks here. A month there. Then I’d take one drink and say “see ya later” to anything and everything. 

The last straw happened before we were supposed to take a trip to Chicago for a concert. I had not had a drink for 28 days. We were doing great. She was proud and happy and I was proud of myself as well. I had one drink while working a wedding... a fuc\*ing Moscow Mule.  Those Russians, they'll get ya.  I was off. Drunk three days before the trip, the whole trip and the way home. She didn’t accompany on my week long bender, she stayed home. 

It was the first time in my life I realized I chose drinking over someone who truly loves me for me.  

I gutted through the trip. I faked it. I was sad and on the verge of breaking down. Checking my phone every five minutes. Nothing. She was done. I could feel it. So, to cope, I drank enough to kill a small horse that weekend. All kinds of crap. Stupid stuff that I never drink. Italian cordial shots and weird stuff like that. I was with a traveling salesman, you get the picture. Now, I’ve never really had panic attacks. Anxiety, yeah. But a full blown “this is it, this is where I die, right here on this couch in someone’s living room” type of mental breakdown, never really happened to me.  I was close a few weeks prior, but I just chalked that up to being tired. It's always something other than alcohol. The last day I woke up and knew a panic attack was coming. I could feel something that I had never really felt before. Most likely the same feeling you feel right before you die. So I did what I normally did when I felt like I was losing my mind, I ran from it. I grabbed the first bottle I could find, Gin. “Yeah gin should do the trick” and I mixed it with some Tang, at 7 am. Tang! Like it’s ‘98. I gutted it down. Only two hours until I get on the train, four more after that and I’m home. I just have to get home. 

I get a cab, barely. The gin and tang buzz has me making best friends with the cabby. So funny how drunks always think people are their best friends, when in reality, they’re just drunk at 9 am. Anyway, the impending doom had subsided for the time being.  I get to the station and have to sprint to my train. I'm rarely ever running behind, like I said, unmanageable. I get on the train “I’ll fall asleep, wake up and be home”. Nope. Closed my eyes for about twenty minutes and the panic starts to come back. I’m starting to sweat. I’m tired. Little dots and stains cross my vision, my head is fogged and bogged down. ""I'm dying for sure on this train, this is it"". “I can’t do it” I make my way to the bar car. I manage to tame the shakes as I swipe my card. It’s just me, a very slow and stoic bartender and my medicine. I felt about two feet tall as I sit alone in a booth, staring out the window, trying to find something interesting or hopeful in the never ending fields of Kansas. I begin to cry. And cry. And cry.  The bartender's just looking at me the way anyone would look at a grown man who is drunk at 10am and crying. For 4 straight hours I had tears running down my face and a cold plastic cup in my hand to help get me through it. 

I listened to 2 songs on repeat “Last Time” and “Change 4 Love” over and over again.  All I kept thinking about was how I let my person down, I continue to let myself down, I am not a good brother, I am not a good son, I am not a good role model, I am slowly becoming a statistic and there is zero chance I will ever become anything close to significant if I keep this up. Then it hit me “holy shit, I have to stop drinking”. 

I lived in Vegas for a few years. What a great place for a drunk, right? One of my best friends had a grandfather who quit drinking “cold turkey”. When you’re in your mid twenties, that seems insane and unimaginable. I didn’t believe it. Then they pointed to a bar stool and said “he drank his beer, said I’m done and never went back to it”. I thought that was incredible. That story always stuck with me. Every once in a while someone will say something significant to you. Something about it will resonate and you realize they weren't saying it to you, they were saying it for you.  That story made so much more sense to me on the train, it clicked. I believe I felt, for the first time, what my friends grandfather may have felt that day. The parties over, man. You’re done. You did your dance with the thing and you’ve been off beat for too long. Your life and family are more important than this pint. You're done. 

So, I get home. I call my girlfriend and tell her ""I think I'm ready.  What do I need to do? I will do anything you ask of me.  I need help"".  We talked and I cried and she cried and then I get off the phone, I grab two airplane shots of whisky and four beers.  I wasn't going to get drunk, I was weening myself off. I know, I did it the way you’re not supposed to.  I should’ve checked into a clinic or hospital but I didn’t. Something seriously bad could’ve happened to me and I do not recommend anyone else doing the same. I know myself. I had to go through it alone and face myself. Just me, my mirror and my thoughts. That’s all I wanted. That and the occasional sip of a beer or whisky to keep the edge off. 

What I went through that night and the following day, I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. I’ve had hangovers. This was my body saying “yeah, do it again. Come on. Drink again and we will shut your sh\*t down for good”. There’s a scene from the movie “Basketball Diaries” where Jim is coming off of heroin, that’s how I felt. Not as dramatic, because it’s Leo, but that’s how I imagined I looked. 

I made it through it. And I’m happy to say I haven’t had a drink since. Today marks my two years and I am very proud of myself. My girlfriend and I are better than ever. Both sober. After I was sober for six months, I was finally ready to move back to L.A. where I can pursue my thing and she can get her masters. All was good. Then, about three weeks after we settled in, the whole world shut down. Yeah, perfect. Two recovering alcoholics leaning on one another in a new city. If I was still drinking, there’s no doubt I would’ve drown in my apartment complexes swimming pool. I mean, this lockdown was a drunks wet dream. Free money, no meetings or work. I am so grateful I chose to get sober when I did. 

Since being sober, I’ve made two short films, got into some festivals, made a web series, writing a feature now, made some music that I’ve wanted to make since I was 17, gained some weight, lost some weight, got a therapist and plan to ask the girl I used to drink with every night to be the person I share a home with for the rest of our lives. 

I don’t have a problem being around alcohol. Do the thoughts creep in? Of course. Hell, the last two weeks have been extremely tough. This subreddit helps a lot. I don’t judge, envy or resent anyone who’s able to drink.. I couldn’t do it and that’s the simple truth.  It's not their fault I can't do it, it's mine.  There are plenty of things I can’t do, so I don’t do them. I wrecked every motorcycle I got on when I was a kid, so I stay away from them as an adult. I. Can’t. Drink. You think a person who can’t swim, dives off a boat in the middle of the ocean?  No, they know They. Can’t. Swim. Because they tried it and they almost died. It’s not that simple but it kind of is. I had to admit I was powerless over alcohol, admit defeat, swallow my pride and give 100% of myself to my sobriety. 

To all my guys out there, it’s okay to lose. It’s okay to cry. It’s okay to be in pain. It’s okay to admit defeat. No matter how big or strong you you think are, this thing is just as big and strong, but not undefeated. 

For everyone who thinks it’s hopeless or you’ll never stop, it isn’t hopeless and you will stop, if and when you decide to. Listen when people tell you they love you, because you are loved. If you’ve got a couple hours, days, weeks, months or years sober, be proud of yourself. Be kind to yourself. Be patient with yourself. Sobriety is hardly ever a linear path. Keep going! I promise you there is nothing in life that alcohol has made better. Being present with your emotions and planted in the moment are the greatest joys life can give you. I could slip up tomorrow, I don’t know. What I do know is, I’m two years sober today and my fingers hurt. 

Sincerely,

\-EC

So this is day 50 for me completely sober, with the help of The Big Book, support of my parents and also this group. (thank you!) Before this I had tried (and failed) on more occasions than I care to admit! But this time feels different. I'm 34 years old and drank a bottle of vodka every single morning at 6am as soon as the shop opened, I then functioned as usual until going back to the shop, rinsed and repeated this for about 3 years every single day only stopping when I was passed out. I then tried to stop which ended in a hospital stay and the most severe withdrawals and dt's, actually assaulting a nurse and throwing a fire extinguisher at another because of how bad the dt's were. (I have never hit anyone in my entire life!)

Anyway, I feel after admitting I was powerless to alcohol and conceding that I could never be 'normal' and 'control' the alcohol, the weight lifted off my shoulders, I focused on myself and took Antabuse every day which I'm still on. I am due my license back for driving next month (last year I was due it back but due to a previous ban and blood test result I was told I was too high risk) and know that any blood test now will show 0% alcohol. During this time I have also managed to start 2 successful businesses which I also owe thanks to everyone who have helped me, I'm thinking clearly for the first time in about 7 years now.

I by no means feel like I'm 'over' this or 'cured' because this is a life long fight but I do know that if you have the belief and strength, most importantly the will power you can change your life around, alcohol is a drug and this is a disease for us all, day 50 is a check point as this is a marathon and not a sprint. I hope to be where a lot of you guys are and writing on here in 10 years time celebrating that milestone, but for now, it's 1 day at a time😊

I left my carry-on, on the plane and made my way outside bumming cigarettes until I was fully aware.

My family was waiting for me in that city and I couldn’t explain why I was stuck at the airport. Flash forward 2 months and the person who was sitting next to me on the flight saw me at a bar (I bartend). He asked if I remembered anything and no, of course not. He told me that everyone had asked to move away from me on the flight. He told me exactly my behavior and had his beer and left. I could see the sheer disgust in his face. And rightfully so.

In the midst of the chaos, I realized that something HAD to change. During my own recovery, I felt an urgent need to share mine and others' stories, tools and findings with other people going through the same.

Here's where you come in.

I'm building an online program for people questioning, struggling and/or wanting to make a change with respect to their relationship with alcohol. I've created a survey to help decipher this deeply complex, and personal struggle to shed light on more ways to help others.

I recently adopted a 4 month old kitten and had to take another round of antibiotics so I took it as an opportunity to stay sober and I’m proud to say I’ve made it 10 days with only a few mild urges to drink here and there. However today one of my college classes was canceled after I made sure to wake up early enough to make it on time and even went to get coffee before and that just sent me over the edge. I’m still on campus so I couldn’t get any alcohol but I was so close to saying fuck it and buying a bottle of vodka and now I’m afraid I’m going to cave soon since my mom is having a birthday party today and there will obviously be alcohol and so many opportunities to sneak drinks. 

Not only that but I’m 21 so I can just buy alcohol myself but the temptation of having it the house is so much and I’ve been able to resist it because my parents know I have a “drinking problem” but I can’t talk about it with them because they’re not supportive whatsoever and will just guilt me and ask if I need to go to rehab which makes me feel worse.

I don't want to spin up some sob story or go on a rant about how AA ""doesn't work"" or is ""god-overloaded and unscientific"".  I may have done that years ago but I had a psychic change, truly - that was the result of throwing myself into the middle of AA for years and putting it first above everything.

The result is my life unfolded into something better than I could have ever imagined and my horizons continue to expand.  I'm no longer plagued with the inescapable urge to drink or do drugs, and have long since learned that wasn't the issue to begin with and have grown and changed though writing, meditation, working with others, service, etc.

I don't want to do any of it anymore.  I'm fully immersed in an isolation lifestyle and really don't want to see anyone or do much of anything.  I still attend a few meeting a week and an H&amp;I, but have fallen out of touch with my sponsor, stopped daily practices, never open the book or do writing or work with new people anymore.

I've sponsored a small nation of newly sober alcoholics (I live in an area with a high prevalence of recovery homes and facilities, so there is a never-ending stream of people raising their hand looking for a sponsor) and done service at many levels (from the individual to the intergroup and more) and have learned a lot about myself, etc.

But I'm not immune to the slow, latent degradation in perspective and outlook that plagues an alcoholic like me.  Time alone and distance from the center means a slow moving lens starts to color my vision again, and I'm the last one to realize it as I become convinced that they, the job, the money, the girl, the property, the prestige - is the problem, and not me.

I know all this because I've been here before - there is more than one surrender in long-term sobriety (especially for an emotional-child neurotic alcoholic like me) and letting go / growing up is hard to do.

But I've had some falling outs with people I was once very close to, and friendships and relationships that ended so callously it's hard to show my face at my homegroup of almost 6 years anymore because they are always there and they won't speak to me.  I just want closure on some of these things, I want resolution, and thought it was in the nature of an alcoholic that is practicing the principles to be kind and loving and tolerant.

But I am so hurt by how I've been treated by some ex-friends in the program and these people won't answer a call, text or say a word to me yet sit across from me at a table in a group of men on a weekday evening that I love, and I am so uncomfortable and frustrated by that.

These are friends I've spent holidays with, I know their families, spent long hours on calls discussing sensitive topics as we do and they've been rocks in my life, people I can depend on.  And I, within 6 months, was essentially ghosted by them.  No calls, texts, etc - after relatively small disagreements.  I've never experienced this type of thing in my life, even when I was drinking/using I've been able to mend relationships and am regularly in touch with at least 5 close friends of roughly 15 years or more.

And my head tells me ""this is what AA is composed of.  People that justify and rationalize behavior like that behind the guise of spirituality and through some warped lens have found it okay for some reason to be incredibly cold to a good friend (I am, I know that) and still get up at the podium and preach love and tolerance"".

Together they are the basic foundation upon which the Steps and Traditions that follow are built.  It is a process of ego deflation which allows me to grow as an individual through the Steps, and as a contributing member of a group through the Traditions.  Full acceptance of the First Tradition allows me to set aside personal ambitions, fears and anger when they are in conflict with the common good, thus permitting me to work with others for our mutual survival.  Without Tradition One I stand little chance of maintaining the unity required to work with others effectively, and I also stand to lose the remaining Traditions, the Fellowship, and my life.

So now not only does he think he doesn’t need to work but he’s gonna die people! And he doesn’t feel bad at all that I had to watch him have  seizures and have to call the police. I want to know if I can like hire 2-3 very big strong men to hold him at gunpoint for like …2-3 weeks?? 😂 just so his mind is back to normal. He’s usually normal dude, very into working out and his health but his whole mentality has been “I’m fine” , “I’m gonna do what I want, I don’t care anymore” like what can I do? I’ve considered taking his debit and ID card and driving them to his mom who lives an hour away, or/ and taking his alcohol away. He says both those things he would call the police on me on because it would be stealing. Like what would the police do? I’m actually concerned he would do that so I’m really curious lol I need help and I don’t know what else to do besides force him into some moments of clarity so he can make a good decision, because right  oh get now he is so drunk all the time he can’t even remember conversations we’ve had or the day it is, let alone make a choice to be sober 😢",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37642,public,self,How bad would this be?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pp85ti/how_bad_would_this_be/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Life is better without alcohol.  A.A. and the presence of a Higher Power keeps me sober, but the grace of God does even better; it brings service into my life.  Contact with the A.A. program teaches me a new and greater understanding of what Alcoholics Anonymous is and what it does, but most importantly, it helps to show me who I am: an alcoholic who needs the constant experience of the Alcoholics Anonymous program so that I may live a life given to me by my Higher Power.

I’m a 24 year old male who has been drinking and smoking weed daily since sophomore year of college. My girlfriend lives with me and also enjoys dancing with the devil. 

I admitted to myself several months ago that I’m an alcoholic, plain and simple. Ever since then I’ve been trying to navigate the challenging journey of sobriety with several failed attempts. 

I would stop for a few days and then think I had everything under control. How wrong I was. The day after having a drink I’d find myself waiting at the liquor store at 11am waiting for it to open so I could have my six pack and then smoke half a gram of distillate (85% thc). 

My first failed attempts were a result of me only putting one foot forward and not both. I thought to mysef “I’ll smoke weed to help take my mind off the alcohol,” but as i’m sure others can relate to, that only made my cravings worse. Not just that, but it made my thinking and decision making skills go out the window. Of course I ended right back at square one.. But not this time. 

I’m 7.5 days totally sober and am feeling much more optimistic in life. Don’t get me wrong, the first 4 days were brutal. I had night sweats, hands shaking, incredibly irratible mood, but I knew that this was just my brain chemistry changing and the process of toxin removal had begun. I found what helps me most is reading what others have gone through and what works for them. Knowing i’m not alone in this journey has brought some peace of mind and given me confidence. 

That being said, I know my journey has just begun and I have an enormous amount of work to do. Here are some tips that have been helpful to me thus far in the early stages:

1) Exercise daily and go for walks. This helps take my mind off the cravings in a healthy way.

2) Tell your loved ones and close friends about your intentions to stay sober. Nothing is worse than having a family member or girlfriend asking if you want a beer (atleast for me during the early stages, hopefully this will pass).

3) Listen to podcasts. This is a great way to combat bordom and there are so many different topics to listen to.

4) Netflix/Video games/music/hobbies/sports all help immerse yoursef in something other than drinking.

Ten years later, my drinking never quite seemed to get any better. People were moving on with careers and families, I had a sense I was being left behind.

I’d had no choice but to be sober out there on the trail, it would be hard to find anything to drink with just the contents of my backpack.

That false mindset, a fake belief that I could only get sober by being on what amounted to a deserted island, was exactly what my disease told me to keep me drinking. I was never able to quit work and hike the AT.  I kept working and drinking another ten years. The truth is AA WOULD have worked and it doesn't require me to quit my job to do it!

I was hiking today, as this all came back to me. I realized that whenever I start romanticizing having a drink, it’s always tied to some past feeling. An experience that is long since gone, and simply does not exist anymore. Drinking is never going to bring back this old sensation that only lives in my memories. The AT isn’t going to get me sober.

I’ve started my step five today with my sponsor. Finishing the rest tomorrow. Had to dig really deep and talk about a lot of trauma and I came to realise that I was holding people to a higher account than I had myself and harbouring resentment over things they did to the best of their abilities at the time. I also felt owed something when someone did something that hurt me yet when I did something I should get a free pass apparently because I’m owed it due to my past. The beginning of this step I was bricking it. I’m only half way through and somehow I’m not worried about the second half tomorrow. My thoughts aren’t full of anger and resentment. If anything I just feel that I can pray for them now from a place of knowing they did their best , even though it was wrong. 🙏
Is this the start of spiritual awakening ? Feeling genuinely sorry for predators and people that caused me wrong doing as they are only human too and I think my character defects have clouded that so much. 

My higher power has definitely helped me see the bigger picture today a lot and be able to connect the dots and not have a big black cloud over it all. Tonight I will pray with more sincerity over some people that I didn’t think I’d ever be able to. With no resentment towards them and maybe empathy… not sure if this is the meaning of empathy too.

Don’t know why I even bothered trying again. What’s the point of staying sober? It’s changes nothing. Even going sober for a year didn’t help. Should’ve learned my lesson after that. Hell, it’s actually worse in a lot of ways. And if it doesn’t make me feel any better, what’s the goddamn point? Then again there’s not really a point to anything…

At least being drunk is filling in time. Serves as a distraction from the constant loop of suicidal thoughts always playing in my goddamn head. Nothing else distracts me from it. It’s like my personal Final Destination film up there. Hell, it’s more like 5 Final Destination films. Guess I’ve always been creative, just wish I could use it for coming up with something other than new and exciting ways to kill myself. 

Medication doesn’t work. Therapy doesn’t work. Hell, I “broke up” with my latest therapist earlier today. Sat on the phone with him and endured him telling me about how great it’s gonna be when we’re outta lockdown in a couple weeks. Told him before, makes no difference to me. I don’t go anywhere anyway. Nothing to do, no one to see. Lockdown is just business as goddamn usual. I don’t give a shit about the virus or the situation or any of this. 

Only thing that bothers me about COVID is that apparently if you’ve got mental issues nowadays, everyone assumes it’s cause of that. It’s like therapists and shit refuse to believe it’s possible for someone to not give two shits about any of it because life sucked long before the fucking pandemic showed up on the scene and it’ll suck long after it’s gone. I don’t leave the house and death sounds like a dream to me, so what the hell would I be distressed about?

Anyway, 15 minutes of explaining all this once again and the dude just goes silent, like he doesn’t know how to handle someone as far in the pit as I am. Not sure what clients he expects in that field, but maybe I really am an overachiever when it comes to being suicidally depressed. Either way, I just told him this shit isn’t helping and told him I don’t need his services anymore. He thanked me for my “honesty”. Hah. Closest thing to funny I’ve heard in a while. ‘Cept for the sick joke I call my life, think that one will always be on top.

And so here I am, worthless damn loser, drinking alone once again. Cause I’m a goddamn failure. A miserable alcoholic. Just like my worthless, piece of shit father.

It’s like my personal Final Destination film up there. Hell, it’s more like 5 Final Destination films. Guess I’ve always been creative, just wish I could use it for coming up with something other than new and exciting ways to kill myself. 

Medication doesn’t work. Therapy doesn’t work. Hell, I “broke up” with my latest therapist earlier today. Sat on the phone with him and endured him telling me about how great it’s gonna be when we’re outta lockdown in a couple weeks. Told him before, makes no difference to me. I don’t go anywhere anyway. Nothing to do, no one to see. Lockdown is just business as goddamn usual. I don’t give a shit about the virus or the situation or any of this. 

Only thing that bothers me about COVID is that apparently if you’ve got mental issues nowadays, everyone assumes it’s cause of that. It’s like therapists and shit refuse to believe it’s possible for someone to not give two shits about any of it because life sucked long before the fucking pandemic showed up on the scene and it’ll suck long after it’s gone. I don’t leave the house and death sounds like a dream to me, so what the hell would I be distressed about?

Anyway, 15 minutes of explaining all this once again and the dude just goes silent, like he doesn’t know how to handle someone as far in the pit as I am. Not sure what clients he expects in that field, but maybe I really am an overachiever when it comes to being suicidally depressed. Either way, I just told him this shit isn’t helping and told him I don’t need his services anymore. He thanked me for my “honesty”. Hah. Closest thing to funny I’ve heard in a while. ‘Cept for the sick joke I call my life, think that one will always be on top.

And so here I am, worthless damn loser, drinking alone once again. Cause I’m a goddamn failure. A miserable alcoholic. Just like my worthless, piece of shit father.

Woohoo! Except, now my mind goes to drinking. I’m feeling very conflicted. The last time I was abroad, I was 17, didn’t drink at all (except maybe a glass of wine or two). I feel like I’ll be missing out if I don’t have at least one “night out”. I also wonder, haven’t I earned at least one night? Just one night to “live a little”, especially while I’m on vacation? But then, I also know exactly how that could turn out. And history shows it won’t turn out well. 

I should also add that I had a slip recently after 1.25 years of sobriety. I’m now 2+ weeks back, but  continue to have strong cravings. My depression and anxiety have been bad, but booking this trip, which has given me something to look forward to, has quelled that a bit. It’s also made me realize that had I not gotten sober for that period of time, I wouldn’t have had the money for this trip, I wouldn’t have been able to repair the relationships with the family I’ll be visiting, and I wouldn’t be in what is overall a pretty healthy relationship like the one I have with my partner. 

I have a fantastic sponsor who I plan to talk to about all this. I also go to meetings regularly, and I’ve started to attend church regularly as a way to further explore my relationship with God. I just wish the cravings would go away, or the depression/anxiety that seems to be contributing to those cravings would ease up a bit. I’m on step four and have been for a little while now. I’m starting to think maybe I just need to rip the bandaid off and get through with it.

I am absolutely not trying to criticize AA or anything. I just wanted your take on it, or some advice. 

I'm a 28F, 20 months sober. Since January, I've been had a sponsor who is very nice but doesn't ever seem to reprimand me. She also seems very busy and she often doesn't answer the phone and our stepwork sessions often get cancelled. Sometimes because of her work, sometimes because it's her wedding anniversary etc. To be honest, I don't feel as if I've made that  much progress this year. For the record, I do at least 3 meetings per week and I have 3 service positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then a little while ago, a female fellow/'fella'  called M,  reached out to me. She's 46 years old and nearly 2 years sober. She was primarily in NA but wanted to transfer to AA.  She apparently had the same sponsor, although I didn't know. She too felt very neglected by our sponsor. From what M was telling me, I could make up that she had a problem with pretty much everyone in NA. She was also telling me a heck of a lot of gossip about people from the program. I didn't tell her to stop that, which I know is wrong. But it gets worse. At some point, after nearly 2 days of listening to her gossip, I reached to one of the people she'd been gossiping about and told her. I told person X that M had been gossiping about her. X was obviously furious and called M up. M then apparently turned the tables and now X has blocked me and from what I've heard, never wants anything to do with me again. M then retaliated and badmouthed me a guy from the program I had been seeing, and about whom I had complained to her. Technically, I gossiped about him too, which wasn't very nice of me. So now that guy has blocked me too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's my fault that I told person X that M had been gossiping about her. No clue why I did it. Certainly not spiritual of me to do. If I hadn't done that, M wouldn't have retaliated.  Now my sponsor basically lost it too. Not sure what to do here. Yeah, I guess the standard AA answer would be to look at my own part and make amends. But at this point, I just wanna leave.

I have 10 months sober after a relapse of six years sober and am on step 9, but my resentments regarding my sexual relationship with my wife of 25 years resurfaced so I reworked it and saw where I was wrong and being selfish. I was able to put this resentment behind me again. It burns me open when it’s present.  I See things through her eyes and that she has struggles being she was molested as a child.  (Dead bedroom  is past 5 years as she has realized her sexual abuse has effected her more then she has thought).    Not dead but one sided towards my pleasure and I long to give her pleasure).  I am past the resentment again and we do have sex but it’s rushed and it’s one sided towards my pleasure.  I haven’t been able to give her an orgasm in 2 years plus, but she sees a counselor weekly and is working on it.  I can’t touch her in certain areas and it’s always the same hurry up and get it over and about my pleasure.  Bet that sounds like nothing but resentment :) 

Now I don’t force her and really try not to pressure her but I am sure some or my advances are pressure like although they are playful and gentle. 


So she is the one to always initiate and I think it’s because she feels like she has to and at times it’s because she wants to make me happy.   But isn’t that having sex for my own selfish sexual needs? If the other person has no interest in Sex isn’t that me having sex for my own selfish needs?   

It says in the big book to work toward your ideal sexual partner through prayer for the right ideal, to question each situation and pray for strength to do the right thing.   If that doesn’t work we help others to over come the urge.  

Well my ideal sexual partner is someone that is just as interested in receiving sexual pleasure as giving it and can be open to the spirituality and curiosity of sex.   Not sure if this will ever happen again. We are in marriage counseling 3 years and little change on the intimacy front.   

So I struggle with my own selfish needs even when she initiated and my ideal sexual partner.  Big book seams to be real vague in this regard.   

So if I am suppose to strive towards my  ideal sexual partner but how is that possible when the other person isn’t interested.   I really struggle with own selfish needs and being able to express myself sexually with a open and willing partner.

Good judgment, a careful sense of timing, courage and prudence - these are the qualities we shall need when we take Step Nine.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 83

To make amends can be viewed two ways: first, that of repairing damage, for if I have damaged my neighbor's fence, I 'make a mend', and that is a direct amend; the second way is by modifying my behavior, for if my actions have harmed someone, I make a daily effort to cause no further harm.  I 'mend my ways', and that is an indirect amend.  Which is the best approach?  The only right approach, provided that I am causing no further harm in so doing, is to do both.  If harm is done, then I simply 'mend my ways.'  To take action in this manner assures me of making honest amends.

this group is absolutely insane. listen, i’ve been in AA for 5 years in atlanta. complete abandon is 100% not AA and i do not condone going to their “home group” or meetings. (it used to be in stone mountain and i believe it’s in doraville now). i know some people that have been able to get out and what they do is basically brainwashing. they prey on newcomers trying to get sober, they claim their way is the best way to get sober. it isn’t true. they force newcomers to immediately start recruiting others, if you don’t meet your “quota” they berate you in front of the entire group and you have to be a “slave” for the entire week. (basically getting cussed out and forced to do another persons work for a whole week). they skim 25% off of your paycheck each week. they claim that outside AA meetings are bullshit and only go to outside AA meetings to recruit and “gather information.” then they go back to their home group and literally have meetings that make fun of the outside meeting. they say that if you leave you will drink and die; and that’s how they get you to stay, out of fear (like all cults). they make you cut ties with family and friends. they told one guy i know to quit his job and get rid of his dog if he actually wanted to stay sober. they don’t approve of any medications either. i know people that have told me people have died in their care because they were overseeing “detoxes” which is so dangerous. people have killed themselves because complete abandon forced them to get off of their psychiatric medication, claiming that “the group will cure you, not meds”. it’s so wrong. this crazy stuff all happens gradually over time, initially they are very convincing and kind, but really it’s just to recruit more members. 
this “group” is a cult. they will brainwash you and ruin your life. i am sober through regular, approved AA and i am so angry they are stealing people’s freedom.

I partied hard in college, but no harder than anyone else.

After a few years out I realized I was still drinking socially and ocassionally after a workday eventhough it just numbed my emotions and made things worse.

I mean like I would drink 1-2 drinks a week, and possibly 5-6 on a night out. In college those numbers were 3-4 week and 7-8 on an ocasional night out.

Never blacked out, never been in trouble, never hid my drinking, though I have made some dumb choices when drunk.

After a while alcohol stopped agreeing with me. So I decided to stop. I notice that it's challenging, that my friends pressure me, and that alcohol is actually a very common thing around my life. I associate it with fun and it's hard to have fun without it.

I realized it was challenging to stop, so I decided to go to 2 AA meetings this weekend.

The stories I heard were so terrible, the amount of alcohol so drastic, that I really felt like I didn't belong.

I am really struggling to accept the fact that my ex won't even acknowledge my amends request- he is completely avoiding and blocking me since breaking up in active addiction. I am over a year sober now. He has withdrawn from most people and his parents still contact me every now and again. I just don't understand why he'd block me and refuse to talk to me for so long. I know I'm probably in the wrong, but I just can't understand why he continues to prolong the pain for both of us(we never had the chance to discuss our break up, it just all ended over the phone one night, obviously largely due to my drinking- the way we broke up and why we broke up +the endless fighting around it). It's just incredibly painful for me because he's leaving me hanging and the few times we have spoke, he has sent me mixed messages saying we will talk again etc etc, but then he blocks me out of the blue for months on end again. I don't know it's just all very emotionally confusing to me. I don't understand why he can't just acknowledge the amends I sent him or just rather lay it on me RE why he is angry at me instead of giving me the silent treatment and no closure.

Any tips on how to handle and accept this? Acceptance RE a bad reaction or no reaction to an amends or extreme unforgiveness when you've worked your ass off on repairing your life and relationships and being better. It just gets really really discouraging.

Earlier this year I saw a PCP for the first time in a couple years and a few months ago I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease due to slightly high liver numbers. The doctor told me to stop drinking, but I haven't. I'm 30 years old and never really considered myself an alcoholic, but I do have a really bad history of binge drinking on weekends. Definitely less since this news. I would say the last few years I averaged a couple beers here and there a few week nights and then like 4-8 one day of the weekend. Covid definitely slowed my drinking down because I have a hard time not drinking in social settings.

I had a follow up a few weeks ago and they had a student doctor come in and she started asking me questions about my drinking. I was very honest. She asked me how many times I've blacked out in the last few years and I started crying because I couldn't answer since it's more than I can remember. She then encouraged I look into alcoholics anonymous, which caught me off guard. I thought this was just a follow up appointment to pat me on the back for losing 15 lbs since my last appointment. The doctor eventually came in and had a real tough love conversation with me, telling me I need to stop for my health and because I'm going to become a dad in about a month. She said my fatty liver was likely the type caused by alcohol.

I left wondering if doctors recommend AA for anyone who admits to drinking regularly or if it was because I'm going to be a dad. My liver numbers have gone down, so I also have been wondering if the fatty liver was the doctor being dramatic. She did say it was not severe. My partner was shocked when I told her what the doctor said about AA. (Obviously being pregnant she doesn't drink but she's never been a big drinker either.) My best friend also told me I'm not an alcoholic, but I would say she's part of the problem, because I can't remember the last time I've hung out with friends and not drank.

I haven't told friends and I've had a few social outings where I was drinking since that appointment. Labor weekend I tried to replace the beers with an edible, but I still ended up drinking. When I drank I asked friends that were leaving to take all my beer and they said ""we'll just come drink and watch football soon"". I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should stop all together. Should I attend a meeting? I feel like I want to make a change before becoming a dad.

I'm worried my brain won't heal if I'm taking the valium but psychiatrist said it very low dose and safer than alcohol as far as brain damage. I exercises daily and eat well.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 87

In recovery, and through the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, I learn that the very thing I fear is my freedom.  It comes from my tendency to recoil from taking responsibility for anything: I deny, I ignore, I blame, I avoid.  Then one day, I look, I admit, I accept.  The freedom, the healing and the recovery I experience is in the looking, admitting and accepting.  I learn to say, 'Yes, I am responsible.'  When I can speak those words with honesty and sincerity, then I am free.

I don’t have the shakes or anything like that. But on my days off I would drink that 15 pack or drive buzzed to get more.

I spent 5 long years on one particular job site and it became a very toxic environment for me. My health deteriorated and my spiral into alcoholism was deep and painful. Coupled with a new baby in the house I finally lost my way just over 3 years ago, and my mental health and extensive drinking made me reach my bottom. I reached out to a fellow member and he took me into AA and 3 years later (7th Sept was my 3 years) I am still clean and sober and my mental health is vastly improved. 

Then recently I was asked to head back to that project site to help dig the Company out of a hole. I’ve fast tracked in my career in the last 3 years being away from the booze and now head up our Companies sector that this project falls under. So when I was asked it wasn’t much of a choice, I have the most experience and I know the project. But I made it clear I couldn’t do full time, knowing that it had the potential to not be a good place for me mentally. A couple days a week max as I have other things running alongside which I want to concentrate on. However to start with they needed me full time. As a colleague is away for 3 weeks. 

I am now a week in and I cannot tell you how much of a trigger this place has been for me. It’s like stepping back in time. Like I never left and my mental health has begun to already feel the anguish this place has associated to it for me. The memories of the things I did and the countless lunchtimes and nights spent drinking my pain away in the local hotel bars, being days away from losing my family. 

I don’t feel like I want to drink, I know where that leads. But the triggers feel so real and powerful that it does scare me what could unfold. 

I guess I’m looking for a way to compartmentalise the past period spent here vs now. How do I make it a different beast so that it doesn’t lead me into a similar path.

I was somewhat wondering if this was the right place to post. I would never call myself an alcoholic but I did have a period in my life 4-5 years ago where I was self-medicating at work. Basically when going out for lunch with co-workers I would have a sip of whisky or vodka to be relaxed. Basically social situations made me really anxious. Had about 2 shots. So I was never really hung over and I could easily keep working. Didn't harm anybody and nothing. Didn't really impair my ability to function at work. (slithgly maybe)

I'm currently in therapy and try to adress the root causes of my problems which ... seem to have to do with shame, social anxiety as I mentioned and a strong inferiority complex and I guess a lack of validation from my father when I was a child &amp; teenager... parents fighting a lot. I was bullied, etc.

Now I know drinking at work is not strictly forbidden in some countries like the US but in my country it is forbidden and there is a chance I would have lost my job if somebody found out.

Now I have all this old shame and incredible guilt coming up as well as this strong feeling in my body that I have to hide something ... from my co-workers ... from my parents. They don't know and they never will because it would only drive my shame / inferiority feelings even higher. I thought I forgave myself but it seems my nervous system thinks otherwise. I have just had a lot of dreams from back then come up ... where I was trying to keep my secret ... trying to hide ... trying to keep people from seeing what I did there.

# My question:

Do you have any recommendations how to deal with this very strong feelings of shame and guilt about what I did? It feels like I did something really bad. It feels like this feeling of having to hide something is still locked in my body. I feel like I have to wear a mask whenever I see co-workers.

Ofc it doesn't help that it's shame which started all this. ... It feels like a vicious cycle.

Any ideas?

To have courage, to be unafraid, are gifts of my recovery.  They empower me to ask for help and to go forth in making my amends with a sense of dignity and humility.  Making amends may require a certain amount of honesty that I feel I lack, yet with the help of God and the wisdom of others, I can reach within and find the strength to act.

I am looking for advice regarding persistent symptoms as a result of a single binge drinking session I had, alone, the other night. **I want to know whether it is likely or unlikely (in your estimate) that I received neurological damage due to an alcohol overdose from an event of which I will outline for you.**

**Facts about me:** 19 years old, skinny, fast metabolism, **non-drinker** (very rarely! I have binge-drunk before - maybe a couple of years ago -  and have not received any persistent impairment before excluding a temporary hangover)

**Incident:** This took place on **Monday 6th September (The persistent nature of the symptoms has urged me to consult Reddit). It has been nearly a whole week since the drinking binge.**

I drunk around five coffee mugs *only 2/5ths full* of vodka over a **3-4 hour period**. Then I fell asleep (I am pretty sure I did not pass out) and slept for around 12-15 hours (I usually sleep only 6-7 hours per night).

**NOTE: I had eaten earlier but sparsely. Also, I did not hydrate with water during drinking the vodka / (obviously) whilst sleeping.** 

**Results:** So, it must be noted that I have had pretty severe and persistent mental illnesses for many years. Of late, I have been particularly dissociative / potentially delusional - so, please factor this into your advice / decision whether or not I could have received more than temporary neurological damage from the single binge-drinking night. Consequently, the potentiality exists that, as my mental illness has been more extreme of late, I am psychosomatically imposing the symptoms which I will outline for you. That is, they may be psychological rather than neurological. Or, they may be a bit of both. So what are the symptoms? Well - and this is where the potential for self-delusion comes in as I am pretty sure one cannot feel the exact region of neurological damage as the brain has no nerve receptors - I am experiencing a strange tingling / emptiness in the left side of my brain. Only the left side, however. I  noticed the feeling only after I got through the hangover (which last but a day). Then, upon self-analysis, I realised that my inner dialogue / personality feels much more muted / dull. 

So, here ultimately are my symptoms:

(1) Strange, tingly, empty sensation persistent in the left-side of my brain (Only the left-side. It feels as if I can feel the damage, the now vacuous place where once were healthy brain cells)

(2) Muted,  dulled personality / inner mental activity

**!!! HOWEVER, I COMPLETELY ACCEPT THIS WHOLE ORDEAL MAY BE SELF-WILLED. I DID NOT EVEN DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF VODKA. ONLY 5 MUGS WHICH WERE ONLY 2/5THS FULL. YET, THIS IS STILL WAY OVER THE INTERNATIONALLY-ADVISED LIMIT FOR ALL PEOPLE, ALL AGES. ALSO, THIS WAS ONE OCCASION. I HAVE NOT DONE THIS LONG TERM. I DRINK VERY RARELY. THIS WAS ONE BIG MISTAKE.** 

So, is it likely / unlikely that I damaged my brain?

If the symptoms persist, I will be consulting a doctor.

However, I am also afraid that it may be 60% self-willed. As I said, I have been suffering with more mental health (psychological) recently. So, I don't trust myself to accurately assay the symptoms I am feeling and whether/whether not they are a result of my single 4-hour alcohol binge.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37435,public,self,PLEASE HELP: The Potential Damage I Received To My Brain By One Binge Drinking Session,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pm0hwz/please_help_the_potential_damage_i_received_to_my/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

I have just over one year sober, and I went with a gentleman that has 20 years. I barely know the gentleman except seeing him at a few meetings. I was suggested to assist by a mutual acquaintance. 

&amp;#x200B;

We met with a gentleman that was not so much intoxicated but rather was drinking to prevent DT’s. He appeared of the hopeless variety as described in the book “Alcoholics Anonymous”. This gentleman said he has short bouts of “sobriety” followed by longer bouts of daily drinking, non-stop drinking. He said God isn’t real. That no God would save him. That he was happy it worked for us but that it would never work for him.

My thought, as a man with 1 year clean, was that “if he doesn’t want it, we can’t force it.” My partner (the gentleman with 20 years) didn’t flinch. As our drunk friend wallowed, Mr. 20 years all of a sudden just said he’s ”done with the bullshit. Let me ask you some questions”. What I experienced next is I can only describe as an intense spiritual experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. 20 years asks: “When you drink, do you have the inability to stop when you plan on stopping?”

The man replies: “Yes.”

Mr. 20 years: “ok so that by definition means your an alcoholic. Do you accept that?”

The man replies: “Yes.” (He’s crying by now)

Mr. 20 years: “Do you believe, that if a power that was greater than you existed, that it could restore you?”

The man replies: ”I don’t believe in God.”

Mr. 20 years: “I didn’t ask if you believe in God. I asked if there was a God, do you believe that it, whatever the fuck you want it to be, that it could restore you to sanity as it has myself and this man (Me)?”

The man replies: “Yea, I guess.”

Mr. 20 years: “Ok that’s good enough. Now get on your knees. You’re going to pray with me. I want you to say these EXACT words as I say them.“ (He then recites the 3rd step prayer, 1 sentence at a time so that the man can reply).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* At this point, is where it happened. I don’t care what anyone thinks. The mans face went from white to color, like the blood came back. I felt willingness in him, from him. I was out of my body as I sat observing all of this.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Mr. 20 years pulls out a notebook: “ Ok, here’s a notebook and a pen. I want you to make 3 lines going up and down. Now we work up to down, not across ……(obviously he’s beginning to do the 4th step).”

&amp;#x200B;

Now after this point details don’t matter, Mr. 20 years showed him the basics of a 4th step, he told this helpless man that he was coming over in 24 hours to check on him blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT THIS IS THE POINT OF THE POST:

I have never experienced someone just trudge through the first 4 steps (I guess just 3 steps because the man didn’t actually write an inventory)  in 10-15 minutes, let alone with someone still smelling of alcohol.

After, I asked Mr. 20 years: “Do you do this with everyone?” 

Mr. 20 years replied: “No, only to people that are about to drink when I leave. And it’s never not worked.”

We had some discussions, and Mr. 20 years shared what he believed was the truth.

1. AA is currently a mockery of what Bill and Bob created. Anyone that doesn’t do the 12 steps as suggested in the Big Book is not doing AA. They are doing something, but not AA. The 12 steps are the only program of recovery according to the Big Book, and a spiritual awakening is the only result of working the 12 steps.
2. Bill W. And Dr. Bob S. Would roll in their graves if they saw what AA has become. In the chapter “Bills Story”, Bill goes through the steps (not yet steps)  with Ebby by meeting with Ebby 3 times (@ Bills house; @ bills house; @ hospital). Bill instantly then carries his message. In the story “He Sold Himself Short” (page 263 of the 4th edition of Alcoholics Anonymous) the narrator (Earl T.) describes meeting Dr. Bob in Akron where Dr. Bob takes him through the Six-Step program (still not the 12 steps that we know) in “three or four hours“.

My revelation, which might not be a revelation, is that AA as we know it has diverged from what it was. I believe that success in AA has dwindled from 93% at the Akron Group to approximately 3%-7% in general because there is an emphasis on slogans (easy does it; one day at a time) and meetings, which was never the intention. The original intention was to find a ”drunk”, push him through the 12 steps as quick as possible, and send him out to save others. We don’t see this. I hear “old timers” that if I didn’t know better were newcomers from the content of their shares. I hear someone with 16 years say “meetings meetings meetings” and then goes on for 5 minutes taking other peoples inventory. I don’t hear “Experience Strength and Hope.”  I hear “I’m sober 18 months and am still working on my 4th step” which to me sounds like an easier softer way. And it’s no body’s fault. They were taught this by their sponsor, who learned it from their sponsor. But its killing people. Seriously. I was 7 years sober, taking my time as my sponsor suggeested, cut back to 1 meeting a week where I aired my grievances: AND ALL I WANTED WAS TO PUT A GUN IN MY MOUTH. I now realize Why. I wasn’t practicing the principles in all my affairs and I was taught not to! What we take as AA is really just group therapy. People talking about their day. No hope. No commitment to share the gift with the newcomer. Just a friendly “Keep Coming Back” Or “Just don’t drink”. I’m sorry. I suffer form a disease that is trying to kill me. It either wants me to die by the bottle or by the gun. Am I crazy?

Sometimes I think: 'Making these amends is going too far!  No one should have to humble himself like that!'  However, it is this very humbling of myself that brings me that much closer to the sunlight of the spirit.  A.A. is the only hope I have if I am to continue healing and gain a life of happiness, friendship and harmony.

I think all newcomers should identify as alcoholics regardless of “drug of choice,” and I think freedom from alcohol and helping others to achieve this is the primary purpose of the entire thing. I also think that many of us are mentally disordered, addicted to other drugs, traumatized, beaten down, and battered. If I was ever told that I needed to go do some more “research,” that I was “too young,” that I could smoke pot or do LSD because it’s an “outside issue,” well I probably would’ve done just that as an impressionable newcomer. I owe my life to the old timers who were real with me and accepted me the moment I walked in the door. Personally I think NA is a waste of time because alcohol is the most powerful drug known to man and is only legal because all hell would break loose if it weren’t.

I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy, pure trauma bonding. How to develop OCD in 12 months.

I am a college graduate with a bachlors degree in psychology. While this is not much, it is much more than anyone managing this program has to offer.
I fully believe that a program like this should not be used under ANY circumstances. The few times that it does succeed does not justify the hundreds of other times that lead to extensive trauma and/or death of the addict upon leaving this program. Failure to thrive in this setting for a highly impressionable young adult and addict leads to unbearable feelings of failure and guilt, which in most cases results in certain death. The program wants to believe that this is due to the nature of the addict but realistically relapse related death occurs at a higher frequency when compared to other rehab facilities. Below, I will illustrate the core mechanics of the program to the best of my ability.
The core of the program relies on doing daily chores. This involves a revolving weekly chore list. Typically you receive two or three chores. Failure to ""master"" a chore based on the mercy of the house manager leads to repeating the chore or having to do more of the chore. All mistakes lead to extensive repetition in hopes that doing more of the thing you hate will make you better at it. Each chore takes 2 to 3 hours to complete. The chores are exensive to the point of being gratuitous. Upon the completion of a chore, you call for the house leader, who then checks off the chore systematically. Did someone walk through and cause a peice of dust to fly into the floor where you just mopped? Missed a spot drying dishes? Did the house leader find a spot that a speck of dust was not removed? Leave a smudge of windex? That's a ""ding"" If you get three dings on a chore, that's a strike. This is the next core mechanic, that is the strike system. Anything the manager deems to be incorrect can result in a strike. Not following through, defending yourself during dinner, talking at what the manager deems to be the wrong time, people pleasing, are all examples of what can lead to a strike. You are expected to get a fair amount of these. Strikes gain interest depending on how many times the ""offense"" or mistake is made. The next mechanic and core component of this program are words. Strikes result in words that increase depending on frequency of occurrence. These words are a numerical amount that you must write on a subject that the essay monitor (a separate chore) decides. Still, the topics are random and come from the group itself or Google searches. The next core mechanic is ""solutions"". Accruing 1000 words or more on any one strike leads to being put on ""solutions"" here you cannot speak to anyone else but the house leader about program related topics, fidget or bop your head, or stare at the TV for too long. If you perceive that you have been accidently touched by someone on solutions you must say solutions, or be on it. ""Cover pulls"" are another core mechanic in where you must, once daily, correct someone's behavior. This happens in the moment and then must be written down in the form of a ""reality check"" which is a positive and negative about people in the house. This almost always leads to additional strikes.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37412,public,self,Has anyone heard of a rehab like this?

Alcohol has caused my kin and I an immeasurable amount of pain and suffering, even now I am haunted by the transforming shadows of forgotten deeds that I will never truly know. I will forever be the villain in the stories of so many, and from what I hear, for good cause. I've spent a great deal of time attempting to lay these demons to rest so that I may live a happy and fulfilling life. Even now, a voice freshly buried attempts to crawl to the surface as it screams and beckons to me. It wants nothing more then for me to give in to its acrimony of compunction that has long lost any sense of purpose. Evasive, it is, that to simply name it invokes a primoradial sense of discomfort. Say hello to the monster in your closet, shame! I never realized until much later just how much time and energy I'd spent avoiding this simple yet caustic emotion. I think about how much shame and embarrassment contributed to me returning to the behavior that masqueraded so cleverly as the answer. Now I come to find that this perceived solution was the convoluted function of a variable in a very long equation.

Now, using the lens of newly acquired knowledge, and through the power of hindsight, I am able to finally locate the nexus of my addiction. At some point, I felt such an overwhelming amount of shame that I deemed myself a complete failure. I'd simply used too much white-out and it was no longer hiding my mistakes. At least not in a way I found satisfactory; I wanted to hide the mistakes, but it wasn't for anyone else. I wanted to forget, what I really wanted was to throw the whole paper away. The white-out via black-out method I had employed only worked so long as I overwrote my saved data with even worse data. What was more was that it only allowed me to feel okay while engaging in the behavior. I simply couldn't cope with the silliest mistakes, due to my now well understood, insecure attachment style and anxiety.

Later in life I would find myself very lonely, just fired out of a dream job, I really believed I had no future prospects. I was desperate for company, and knew that knowing what I knew about myself, there was no way that was going to happen sober. I was getting trashed daily in an attempt to form a meaningful relationship with a woman, typical behavior for me. I had no standards, and asked a random girl online if she wanted to hang out. We met, she was physically deeply flawed, particularly in the dental category. Still, what she lacked in teeth she made up for with other features and personality, I'd tell myself. She had a big house, a ton of money, a big tv, she was a chef, had a dog, this was perfect. ""I will never need a job, I probably couldn't get and keep one anyway"", I'd tell myself. I'll just pretend to like her for a while, get free shit, then I figured it would die down. Still, despite every red flag I threw at her, every misdeed, she kept moving full-steam ahead. I kept the lie going, I never could be the one to end things.

I'd have to be pretty drunk to trick myself into believing that I was actually enjoying her presence... On the matter of sex however, I had to be practically blacked-out. Even now, I can only actually recall having sex with her a handful of times. During all of this, I had the craziest thought, ""why don't I just marry her and keep the lie going forever, maybe it will stop being a lie"". I went against my moral compass, I even told my parents that were intensely confused but still supportive as always. Anytime they would question the relationship I'd simply tell them that I was happy and that I had finally learned to actually love her. I never course-corrected, I only picked up speed as I looked back at the now completely unrecognizable path I had taken, yup, I was lost alright. I was driven purely by ego and pleasure, only caring about myself.

At some point, I took on a new identity. I embraced all things evil. That is who and what I was, ""I am a bad person"", I said. Once I accepted this now, fact about myself, I was in a freefall. I continued to do increasingly worse things as I used my last terrible thing to justify my next. No one said anything... no one tried to stop me. I still had everything, and due to not having to see my parents, I thought they believed my illusory happy life. My health saw steady decline, I gained 150 lbs, my liver was starting to fail, my skin was destroyed by guttate psoriasis, I fell into an unspeakable depression...this went on for almost 2 years.

She began to take interest in someone at work, I saw it coming from a mile away, she'd finally had enough. I asked my parents to find me a place to live. My parents already had a plan, I'd go to a rehab in California. Like a deeply-embedded parasite being baited by a raw piece of meat, I was afraid, I was angry at the world, but the thought of smoking weed by the ocean had me on a plane the next day. I lost everything in my vicinity, even the dog that I had called mine for 2 years. I didn't actually have ownership of anything. I settled for nothing and in return chose to live a lie so long as the alcohol and drugs kept flowing. I was sent to Awakening Recovery in Beverly Hill's, California. Who knew such a place could exist? All of these rules were thrown at me, I was already dealing with PAW's and this was my first time trying to ""get sober"". Reality hit hard, and this brand was particularly cruel. I spent 26 days at this facility, most of my days were spent in a state of pure horror as I learned about the rules of the house. If you even take a step outside of a room without turning a light on, that's a strike. Strikes mean you have to write words, everything had a rule. Each time from 5:30AM-12AM you were doing choirs or writing words for missing a spot on the dishes. This was in an effort to teach accountability. I was stranded in California, you were not allowed to talk to your parents. I couldn't speak to them unless supervised and would not be given a cell phone or allowed a job for 6 months. I could not speak my native tongue with my parents, I tried to call my dad in the middle of the night in a panic and was punished for it. What was more is, I was being told that I was crazy, my addiction was talking, and my parents said I would not be allowed to return home. I'd have to become homeless in LA. I can still hear the pain in my dads voice as he told me this on the phone. I'd come to find out they had sent him a packet saying that I would try to go home and that I was being manipulative like I always have been. Once my stimulus check hit, it was over, like a computer being powered on. As soon as the decision had been made, I was unshackled, I took the power back and took the biggest leap of faith in my life. I was fairly certain my parents would catch me, but I really didn't know this time. If you decide to leave this facility they simply make you walk out the door and do not help you find arrangements, it's part of the program, its why people stay. People not only have no where to go but they fear their parents may really abandon them in LA out of all places. Knowing I had that stimulus money was enough for me to make the jump, even though it wouldn't realistically have covered the cost of making it back. I left, they do everything they can to start a fight with you before you go, insane. I saw someone get kicked out by the seniors there, every Wednesday, the graduates would come and ""group"" you. Pick out any mistakes you made and tear you apart. I kept trying to call my parents, they refused to speak to me. I found a hostel and really didn't know how much longer I had, I just knew for a fact I was never going back to the Awakening sober living, I would die before being subjugated to some new forms of punishment that they felt like making up.

All of this to say, my whole time in rehab has all served to teach me how absolutely batshit insane the addiction treatment industry is. Eventually, I went to another rehab that had its own set of problems, experienced a HIPAA violation and abuse of all sorts. Still, I did have one good counselor that specialized in trauma. I am a psychology major, so just learning about the therapy was really cool. In all I had over six months completely alcohol free. That is, until I made the conscious decision to drink again. I do not want to count time, this sounds like the perfect excuse to kill yourself on a relapse plus I still believe that I can drink safely and responsibly AFTER having learned everything that I have, mostly on my own. My extensive research on addiction all suggests that treatment centers are doing more harm than good, along with AA's addiction model as being the most harmful development when it comes to addiction. The way that we think about addiction is the problem, and it is all painted by an arbitrary singular brush that is the AA hive-mind. Subsequently, treatment centers think this same way. The fact of the matter is, I made a choice to give up and give in, to take advantage of people, to hurt and kill even, I did this. I have a bottle Bacardi sitting in my freezer right now, I don't want to drink it. I have had it since last Friday, I had exactly 3 shots yesterday night. Nothing less, nothing more. That is what separates those of us who can actually beat this thing and those of us that stay sick or unhappy, doubting themselves forever with the ""disease of alcoholism"". The fact that we can not only talk about ""Accountability"" but actually engage in the act. We do not accept feelings of shame anymore. We accept that we are humans, and that we make the wrong choices, that we are selfish, that we seek pleasure at the cost of others and that humans can be exceptionally cruel but that they can also be amazing, resilient, compassionate, kind, caring, intelligent, and every other good adjective you can think of!

&gt;Ninety days sober cleared my thinking enough to make me realize I’d hit bottom. If I were to go back to drinking, it would be just a matter of time before one of two things happened: I’d succeed at suicide, or I’d start the life of the living dead. I’d seen what the latter looked like, and real death was preferable.   
&gt;  
&gt;At this point I surrendered. I admitted I was an alcoholic without a clue what to do about it. Many of the people around me wanted me to go to treatment, but I resisted. I didn’t want the kids at school to know what was going on. If I went to treatment, they’d all know within a week. More importantly, I was afraid. I was afraid the treatment center would test me and say, “You’re not an alcoholic. You’re just crazy.” My heart knew this wasn’t true. My head took a bit more convincing. The thought of having A.A. taken away from me was terrifying. A.A. was my anchor in a sea of confusion. Anything that might pose a threat to my sense of security was quickly thrust away. I didn’t have anything against treatment centers then, nor do I now. I simply didn’t want to go, and I didn’t.   
&gt;  
&gt;I did stay sober. One summer with people who enjoyed life sober was all it took for me to want sobriety more than I wanted a drink. I will not tell you I did everything I was told, when I was told, how I was told, because I didn’t. Like most people new to the program I set out to find an easier, softer way. As the Big Book suggests, I could not....

&gt;...No one who drank as I did wakes up on the edge of the abyss one morning and says: Things look pretty scary; I think I’d better stop drinking before I fall in. I was convinced I could go as far as I wanted, and then climb back out when it wasn’t fun anymore. What happened was, I found myself at the bottom of the canyon thinking I’d never see the sun again. A.A. didn’t pull me out of that hole. It did give me the tools to construct a ladder, with Twelve Steps.

I’ve just passed three months of sobriety and taken my first step. 
Tomorrow is the two year anniversary of my mother’s death. We had a complicated relationship, and I still have a lot of feelings about it. I chaired a meeting today about this topic, and I was directed to continue talking to sober people about it. I’ll have in-person 1:1 conversations, but I also wanted to post here. 

In the past, my brother and I would make plans to get together on this date to drink. We drank so hard, once when my husband drank with us he got acute pancreatitis. The man still doesn’t drink! He’s been sober a year and nine months now after acquiring the pancreatitis at my brother’s birthday. And my mother was the one who introduced me to drinking and drugging. Before I was even interested in mind-altering substances, I watched her trading pills with her sister, my aunt. I’d later overdose on those pills two separate occasions, before I looked old enough to score booze. My mother gave me my first tastes of many things. Most notably, vodka. She set a partial bottle in front of me one day and said, “Riotreality, you have good, stoic, Ukrainian blood in you. You can finish this vodka.” I did. Another time I drank so much with my mother and aunt, I crashed my bicycle on my way home. There was always booze around. My mother died a drunk. I don’t want to, too. I remember being so angry that I screamed at her corpse in the hospital morgue.

I am a 26 year old male looking for some advice on my alcoholism. This addiction has started to affect my work life as well as my home life. I don’t usually drink at home, since my wife got pregnant in February. We used to drink like half a fifth everyday at least in college and into our adult lives. Ever since she got pregnant I have been struggling with trying to stop drinking. I appear as though I am not drinking at home, which I am not. Rather, I get a couple shots in before work, then maybe another small 200 ml during work and a couple shots on my way home. I just can’t handle it anymore. I’ve been sick emotionally and physically with this habit. I have a great job and don’t want to lose it because of this. Alcoholism tends to run in my family (uncles, aunts, etc.) I just want to be able to quit and be the father I need to be for my son. We have about 7 weeks until he is here. While at home I have no issues not drinking, we can watch tv and do work and stuff and I am fine. But when I leave for work in the morning it’s almost like I have to have it before I start anything. This happens on the weekends too, I wake up and instantly want a shot or something. I’ve been making up excuses to go buy alcohol in secret and just drink it before my wife knows. I’m pretty good at getting a buzz then riding it out for awhile. When it fades though I get digestive issues and severe anxiety. I just want to stop but I don’t know how. I know that I have a problem and I just want it to end. I don’t want to feel like shit for the rest of my life. I am fine in public, I can go to dinner and have a beer and be just fine without going overboard. But if I start drinking in the morning it’s like I just keep going until there’s nothing left. Then I’m at work sloshed not getting anything done. I just want it all to end. I want to be better for my family and my work. The feeling of a quick buzz can be so nice. “Not having to deal with the stress” I just need to cut it off.

I’ve never had serious drinking problems but I did form the habit of drinking almost everyday in summer 2021. After a crazy 11 day bender and I felt like my nerves were fried I decided to make my own challenge of “not a sip September” it was soooo hard the first few days the temptations to drink were extreme but I told myself if I could quit weed I could stop alcohol for a month. Only thing I didn’t plan on is so much energy. I’ve been awake now for 18 hours and just feel so wide awake and the crazy part is that I got off my 8 hour shift 4 hours ago. And it’s hard work it’s bussing tables at busy restaurant literally we’ve had more than 10 people quit within the first week because it’s so hard but for me it’s easy now even easier without always hangover and usually I can pass out afterwards even without alcohol and I even worked out before work.

They [the Promises] are being fulfilled among us - sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The Promises talked about in this passage are slowly coming to life for me.  What has given me hope is putting Step Nine into action.  The Step has allowed me to see and set goals for myself in recovery.  Old habits and behaviors die hard.  Working Step Nine enables me to close the door on the drunk I was, and to open new avenues for myself as a sober alcoholic.  Making direct amends is crucial for me.  As I repair relationships and behavior of the past, I am better able to live a sober life!  Although I have some years of sobriety, there are times when the 'old stuff' from the past needs to be taken care of, and Step Nine always works, when I work it.

We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59

I could not manage my life alone.  I had tried that road and failed.  My 'ultimate sin' dragged me down to the lowest level I have ever reached and, unable even to function, I accepted the fact that I desperately needed help.  I stopped fighting and surrendered entirely to God.  Only then did I start growing!  God forgave me.  A Higher Power had to have saved me, because the doctors doubted that I would survive.  I have forgiven myself now and I enjoy a freedom I have never before experienced.  I've opened my heart and mind to Him.  The more I learn, the less I know - a humbling fact - but I sincerely want to keep growing.  I enjoy serenity, but only when I entrust my life totally to God.  As long as I am honest with myself and ask for His help, I can maintain this rewarding existence.  Just for today, I strive to live His will for me - soberly.  I thank God that today I can choose not to drink.  Today, life is beautiful!

I made amends to my dad soon after I quit drinking.  My words fell on deaf ears since I had blamed him for my troubles.  Several months later I made amends to my dad again.  This time I wrote a letter in which I did not blame him nor mention his faults.  It worked, and at last I understood!  My side of the street is all that I'm responsible for and - thanks to God and A.A. - it's clean for today.

At one point, I lived in a setting similar to a commune where my life was very controlled by fundamentalist religion. When I left, some of my worst drinking happened because I felt betrayed by the religious concept I had.

Today, I still go to (now very well vetted) gurus and similar figures because this is a central aspect of the dharmic religious systems I participate in. But I keep the experience at arm’s length in a way I didn’t before.

And yet this isn’t wholly defensive. I’ve realized that real spirituality has to be a spiritually of one’s own understanding. And that means spiritual guides can only be that… guides.

What if a guru was very bad to me? Before I’d assume God wanted to hurt me by giving me a bad guru or worse, be more zealous. Now? I would just go meditate and try to live spiritually without that person.

God of my own understanding means one no one can take away from me. It means spiritual practice no one can “own” to “own me.” For thousands of years, people have prayed, meditated, journaled and confided in one another. No one owns it … and anyone tries to, it doesn’t invalidate the whole thing.

On the opposite side, I’ve often wondered if material success is all there is and in dark hours, if this makes me just a loser. But by comparing the fruits of materialist life and spiritual life, I have to (perhaps sometimes begrudgingly) nod to the power of spiritual life. I can barely get by but work with many millionaires because I went into financial services. They can be miserable and I can be miserable that I’m not miserable in their shoes. But at the same time, thousands of monks and nuns from all kinds of traditions around the world wake up in intentional poverty and live happily. As greed sinks this plan into dire crisis again and again, which way is the only way that consistently succeeds? And who is happier, the loner chasing material ends or the people who are serious in meetings, even if they have little to work with themselves? Though it’s hard to explain why, happy are those whose support does not come from their own effort and who help others along the way.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37321,public,self,A couple thoughts on what the Third Step means to me.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pjhcvo/a_couple_thoughts_on_what_the_third_step_means_to/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel heartbroken and my partner and I haven't officially broke it off. I really don't know what's going to happen. 

He's been with me since I was still drinking and thinking I had it under control but I certainly did not. 

We were supposed to go camping together and spend 5 nights in the woods, no cell reception, just ourselves and the wilderness. 

The day we were supposed to go to his parents to pick up the canoe together he decided to go by himself while I was at work because he's ""not well"" and needed ""solitude"". He texted me this while I was working. I started uncontrollably crying. 

Went home after I finished my shift. Of course my first thought was ""I need a drink"" but as quickly as that thought came in I pushed it out. I talked to my friend who's also in AA and I just remained calm about the situation and started analyzing what he was going through. 

Next day went to visit my friend and we did some therapy shopping and ate some food and hung out. It was a nice distraction. Spent the night and went home the next day. 

He came home the same night as I did only I had already gone to bed before he got home. Figured the conversation could wait till the next day. 

We talked and it was everything I thought. He wants more space and a studio to work out of. Then he brought up how much stress I put him through while drinking. He'd come home and I'd be passed out. Sometimes on the couch in awkward positions. Or snoring loud in bed. He said he'd roll me over and what not. 

He also said he was happy I'm gunna live now. I cried and said I was sorry and that I will not go back. I can't. I won't. I hate alcohol so fucking much. It's taken away so much from me. 

Also he thinks that I forced my moving in with him. He was the one to bring it up and at the time I was struggling hard financially. He said I called him screaming and crying in desperation. 

I was wanting to buy a house with this man and even consider children. He said to me if I noticed that he isn't very nice to me. He never listens to me, we never talk, I feel like I do all the cleaning other than laundry and groceries. I recently started ordering groceries so he wouldn't have to be the one buying all the groceries all the time. Like I've been really trying. I've also lost about 55lbs during the past year and a half. About 25lbs since I stopped drinking. 

He also keeps saying he was ready for all those things before but that I wasn't. And he was scared we would have a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome if we did. But now that isn't even an excuse. 

He asked me if I felt a connection with him? I looked him in the eyes and thought about it and honestly said not always. 

We've had similar conversations in the past but this time I decided to give him space and I am spending a few days at my brothers. I feel like I'm going to insane with my thoughts. 

Before leaving I just asked him to think about whether he wants a future with me or not. 

I feel like I already know the answer. Which is what makes me feel heartbroken. And then the question is what do I do next? 

I feel like such a sad person who is destined to be alone. 

I was starting to think I was becoming a better person, a better girlfriend. 

Sorry for the rant.

 Her whole family has come back into my life and say how well I am doing. This is upsetting her because that's ""her family"".

I've had a problem with alcohol abuse since maybe 15 but didn't start drinking heavily until end of 2019 and 2020. So basically what's happened is last year I suffered with severe social anxiety for a long time and I had signed up for a business course at my local polytechnic but had severe social anxiety all the time in class which made it difficult to learn and get on with work because I'd be swearing, shaking and have to go to the toilet all the time. I also had extremely low self-esteem. But around March 2020 covid struck and lock down occurred so I hit the booze for a couple months I was drinking everyday for months, more traumatic events occurred throughout the year then around November 2020 I ended up loosing quite alot of weight but this wasn't enough to stop me from drinking and around this time I started feeling a bit funny and spaced out/weird but didn't see the connection. Then around December 15th I was involved in a car accident and lost my car. Then continued to drink dispite this, then around January 18th 2021 I woke up one morning 1AM after a binge on 2x bottles of bacardi the days prior and from an extremely frightening nightmare, I woke up drenched in sweat with derealization, memory issues, vertigo, dizzyness, vomiting etc. This to me was when my thiamine must have gotten low. I chalked it up to alcohol withdrawal. But the next day these symptoms were gone. I felt slightly ""off"" everyday and I kept off alcohol for the next 3 weeks until around February 4th - 5th. 

Then around February 4th 2021 I had 1 beer. Then on February 6-8th I had 2x bottles of wine and beer aswell. And I also caught a bad cold at this time. 

Then around February 12th 2021 I woke up one morning and all thr symptoms of the previous time were back and that's when I believe I developed wet brain I went to the ER but failed to tell them about my alcohol use in the past 4 weeks but did tell them about my past heavy drinking for some odd reason and they never thought of it being wernicke-korsakoff but since then things have gotten worse. So at first I had derealization, hypnogogic hallucinations, vivid nightmares everynight, hypnic jerk, diahorrea, abdominal pain in right side, and a couple other things, I also had constant paranoia and OCD tendencies, family seemed unfamiliar and faces seemd frightening I also got this extreme fear I was developing schizophrenia. These symptoms went on for months until around May-June the derealization went away and I started having issues with my memory instead. I also felt like I was having mini stroke episodes and went to the ER for them and got 2x CT scans w/o Contrast both were clear. I also got my thiamine checked on July 13th it was above normal. And I got a bunch of other tests done they were all clear too. 

But as of now today I still have strange symptoms that resemble that of Wernicke-Korsakoff like not being able to remember what I did yesterday this strange wobbly balance feeling when I walk. I feel extremely depressed often, apathy, anhedonia, anxiety, OCD, a bunch of other stuff. I have brainfog all the time my memory is all messed up and I have trouble remembering what happened yesterday and this whole year feels like it was yesterday even though its been 8 months pretty much and also I have trouble accessing my long term memorys so my mind just feels blank 24/7 and I feel spaced out. I will know for certain if it is wernicke-korsakoff as I have an MRI w/ contrast coming up later this month and an E.E.G. I have also been taking high dose oral thiamine 2x per day as well as a plethora of other vitamins daily since July 13th. 

Throught 2020 I also ate a balanced healthy diet too might I add and also took vitamin C daily and oral magnesium in a powder form mixed in with water before bed. And I have been clean from alcohol since February 12th pretty much when all this started I have only drunk on a couple social occasions this year but that's it. So how likely is it I have wernicke-korsakoff?

I drank on the meds anyway.

Lockdown took me to whole new levels where im drunk in work zoom calls, giving presentations to inspire people while being secretly drunk.

I've been  getting away with it for years and despite thinking ""oh she enjoys a drink"", no one knows how much I depend on it. Yesterday I haven't felt so depressed in a long time. Nothing in my head, can't move...and I realise I use alcohol for every single emotional (even the good ones) when it gets uncomfortable. It was okay till it wasn't. Now the hangovers leave me so anxious I cant leave the house, I cant even go to the shop because if someone talks to me ill take a panic attack...unless I drink.

I have 6 interviews this week...and in my younger days I'd drink though interviews to perform without fear of a panic attack. Yesterday I looked at 6 of these knowing my body is ill, I threw up on my sofa the night before, and wet myself a few weeks prior. Im not even angry at myself anymore but im so tired of trying to carry this on my back along with what everyone else expects of me.

I couldn't ever see a future without alcohol. Not really. Today is the first time I've seen its not coming from a place of bravery but from a place of sudden brutal honesty. Im an addict. Im an alcoholic. I surrender to it because if I don't ill die.

Really nervous about the meeting. One of the things I struggle with is crying in front of people and I just know its going to happen. Any tips would be great.

Normally I don't cry at all ...like even when I want to. Apparently I have adhd/ ptsd from a violent childhood and docs always put it down to that but every time I think of going to this meeting and accepting what I am its like I cant stop welling up and crying.

Step Nine restores in me a feeling of belonging, not only to the human race but also to the everyday world.  First, the Step makes me leave the safety of A.A., so that I may deal with non-A.A. people 'out there', on their terms, not mine.  It is a frightening but necessary action if I am to get back into life.  Second, Step Nine allows me to remove threats to my sobriety by healing past relationships.  Step Nine points the way to a more serene sobriety by letting me clear away past wreckage, lest it bring me down.

Hi, Marilyn, 30, female, alcoholic. 
I just joined this group because I’m trying the program for a second time. 
I had over a year sober in 2019 but relapsed. I never got into step 4 with my sponsor and never really felt like she understood where I was coming from. I didn’t feel safe or comfortable getting into the real talk. She never really gave me the opportunity to and made me feel like a lot of people make me feel... Like I overthink and I just need to not do that. But I’m a deep thinker and passionate feeler. 
This second time around I had a call with her and we laid some good ground work. She asked me to write what I will do differently this time around and what I can do I when people bug me (a prevention plan). I expressed to her that what has kept me sober the last five days is the realization that I could lose my family and friends for good if I drink again. I had an ernest talk with my sister prior to my chat with my sponsor and this realization weighs heavy on me. 
Well my sponsor, in an attempt to be helpful, told me that she could give me one more reason not to drink. She said if I drank, she would “fire me.” She said it and kind of laughed but I know she was serious. I felt like shit after that and I think she said it because of my long relapse period up until now. I feel like she doesn’t realize how isolated I feel and how nervous I am I am going to end up with no one to turn to.
The reason why I’m here is because now I feel like she’s holding my sobriety over me. The thought of finding another sponsor is hard for me because I’m in such a delicate place right now. I’m afraid that what she told me was a bit tone deaf. I’m very aware that I can relapse at any second. But I kind of resent her for putting that type of pressure on me. It feels a little manipulative. Even if it’s meant to be for my own good. 
I don’t want a sponsor that will just watch me relapse and relapse again. But I want one that takes me seriously enough that won’t threaten to stop sponsoring me if I were to relapse.
I’m terrified of relapsing. But I also want to be true to myself and what I think are good relationships. I feel like maybe I offended her because my lapse was so long and I didn’t do any step work with her throughout it. She’s older and sickly and doesn’t make meetings anymore, just one on one calls with other alcoholics. So I know she cares about relationships. She is also kind of blunt and a little rough around the edges when it comes to communication. 
I feel like I’m too sensitive of a person to do the steps with her. For example when we did step one she just had me read a prayer (which I meant) but I really wanted to talk about why I felt powerless and what my belief in my higher power could look like. We also did step two and three (read another sentence long prayer). She then assigned me step four. When I expressed how overwhelming it seemed she talked about it like it was much simpler than it I felt it was. But honestly I wasn’t ready to go there alone and even now I am afraid to. I’m also not sure if I feel safe going there with someone who just told me if I fail and I drink, she won’t do this anymore. I guess it’s partly that she doesn’t trust me and doesn’t want me wasting her time. But I do my best not to. I only ever met with her when I felt ready to do the work. But I only met with her twice the year or so I was sober. I wasn’t ready then. And honestly I don’t feel ready now. I have depression and anxiety symptoms and a history of being abused. I thought maybe because she had also been abused we would relate more but now I realize everyone heals differently. When I had that talk with my sister recently I realized that she and my brother both kind of blocked their traumas and moved on. I have another sister that experienced the same abuse and she processed her trauma a little more like I am. By thinking about it and talking about it and confronting our abuser. My sponsor never really talked to her abuser, she kind of just moved on. I have a tendency to overshare because of my deep need for resolution. I used to have a counselor through the county behavioral health services but I no longer qualify for a counselor because resources are limited. I don’t want to re traumatize my sponsor by getting everything out but I feel like I have to really get it out in order to do this right. I don’t even know what to do because I’m so broken I don’t want to subject any one person to my mess. 
I really am putting myself out there and I hope you all are kind of you bothered to read my whole post. I realize I may just have so many character flaws I should just sit down and shut up but if you feel that is that is the case I hope you all can at least say so kindly.
I hope you all can maybe offer some clarity. I dont want to talk to my sponsor yet because I want to be sure I’m coming from an honest place as free from my pride and drinking demons as I can. Maybe I just need to see things differently. And I hope that I can. My convictions can be so strong and I usually try to honor them.

**Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism**

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, 

My name is Saul Celere, and I'm an alcoholic. I'm happy to say that I haven't had a drink since the 1st of January this year, and I'm optimistic about my sober future.

I am also a philosopher and a theoretical physicist. My education was heavily scientific, and like a lot of people in the modern world, I view existence and our Universe logically and scientifically.

Over the last few decades something of a scientific consensus has been reached concluding that God does not exist; not all scientists are atheists, but most of them are, and if you ask a lot of modern people why they don't believe in God, they’re likely to tell you that science proves such ideas untrue.

Until five or six years ago I was a member of this consensus. I thought of myself as a 99% atheist; I wasn't willing to say with 100% certainty there was no God, indeed, to make such a claim would require a God-like knowledge and understanding of existence and our Universe, otherwise, you might be wrong. But I was pretty much convinced.

This conviction of atheism prevented me from using the concept of a “Higher Power” whenever I would try to stop drinking; as soon as I heard any talk of a Higher Power, I would immediately, if privately, dismiss it as nonsense.

But Socrates has been my hero since I was a kid, and he said “Wisest is he who knows he knows nothing”. Well, thank God for Socrates and my 1% of doubt, because five or six years ago I had some scientific insights into the nature of Consciousness that cleaved open this doubt to reveal a new, expanded and very optimistic conceptual picture of our Universe and our connection to It.

Both God and the Human Soul, if they exist, are conscious entities, therefore, any new understanding of Consciousness can, at any time, alter or expand our understanding of God and how we relate to ... + Him+Her + ... ( God is much more than just male )

The scientific insights I had quickly led me to developing a very new and revolutionary, but rigorously scientific, conceptual picture of the Universe in which we live, and move, and have our being.

This has entailed me writing The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness. These principles have general applicability to all conscious systems, just like Newton’s Principles of Motion can be generally applied to all macroscopic dynamical systems. 

These Principles finally allow us to construct theoretical models of conscious entities and systems, such as the human nervous system. And, maybe more importantly, they can also be used to construct the first scientific, theoretical models of both The Mind of The Universe ( read Higher Power, God ), as well as the physical Human Soul.

These models are the means by which a resolutely scientific mind, such as my own, can find the concept of a Higher Power a plausible scientific reality. And, for me, finding a Higher Power genuinely, and logically, and scientifically plausible was absolutely essential to getting sober.

For the first time in my life I felt like I might be able to trust my Universe, that maybe my coming into existence wasn't actually a terrible, terrifying mistake, maybe I hadn't been born into a cold, dead, unfeeling, uncaring Universe, that I was totally separate from. 

Until then, I had conceived of my existence as a brief anomaly of personal Consciousness that would be followed, inexorably, by an eternity of total non-existence, and in retrospect I see how this conception of my existence undermined me as an inescapably moral and spiritual being.

But now God had become possible, and not just possible, but plausible, and even more plausible than no God. After three decades of atheism, this was the hell of a shock!!!  An “I need to lie down and breathe into a brown paper bag” kind of shock! And awe, lots of awe. Awe is quite like fear except it's a good thing, thrilling.

I'd been very unhappy for a very long time and I knew that my drinking was making my life worse and damaging my most meaningful relationships. But life was meaningless, pointless; whether I stopped drinking or not, whether I wound up with a family and friends, or completely alone, my own Universe was still going to eternally annihilate me.

The possibility of a Higher Power suggested the possibility of meaning and hope, meaning and hope that wasn't limited to just this one life I was making a mess of. So, I decided to conduct an experiment, an existential experiment, an experiment with my own existence, in which I was both the scientist and the rat.

I asked myself, “If a Higher Power does exist, what would … + He + She + … advise me to do, and, very importantly, what not to do?” 

Top of the list was to stop drinking, and to really stop. And if I managed to stop for a few weeks, to stay stopped once I inevitably started whispering sweet nothings to myself about “Well, we can have one or two, just on the weekend, with my girl, that's ok…”

I can't say the experiment was a success because it's still going on. I had thought if I were to ever find God it would mean automatic, perennial happiness. In reality it has required me to work harder than I've ever worked in my life. But as I keep up the experiment I can't deny that I am happier than I was. 

The happiness is like when we used to roll a small snowball into an enormous “snowwheel” when we were kids; it gets bigger slowly, imperceptibly, and I have to keep pushing, but it's much more pleasant to be a happy Sisyphus halfway up the mountain, than a sad Sisyphus motionless at the bottom, paralyzed by his own nihilism.

Faith in a Higher Power made me realise my happiness is intimately related to my morality; that I will never be happy as long as I'm not making a concerted effort at self improvement, an effort that I don't abandon every time I get too stressed or have an argument with my girlfriend.

The more seriously I take my moral health the better my life becomes. ( Slowly, and it's hard, and it still regularly shocks me how hard it is; if I were to ever meet God, and assuming I didn't immediately go for His throat, I'd say “All this, the Universe, existence, the stars, Earth, the plants and animals, Humanity etc., it's all amazing, but you've put the emotional, psychological, difficulty level up way too high! ) 

Anyway, all of this began with me finding God a plausible scientific reality, so, I wanted to help anyone who is finding it difficult to reconcile a modern scientific understanding of our Universe with faith in a Higher Power.

Here is a lecture/podcast called “Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction” in which I explain what Principia Theologica is:

[Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction](https://youtu.be/8NQJQN0D9A4)

In the description is a link to episode 1 of around 12 episodes of Principia Theologica, in which I outline a rigorously scientific approach to the Higher Power. If the picture of our existence painted by the modern interpretation of science depresses or scares you, there is great hope and relief to be found in these philosophical ideas and the truth about our physico-conscious being.

Best of luck on your journey!!!

I can admit that now.

I quit drinking 7 years ago. Stone cold sober since, until 11 months ago. “I can have one” I told myself “just a sip”

You know the rest of the story. I did well for months. A glass here or there. Then it got worse. It changed from “I drink and have fun” to “I need to drink to have fun “. 

Finally, it’s gotten to the point where I drink just to avoid the shakes. It’s not fun, I no longer delight in the taste, the effects. I just  want my hands to be steady for a while. To not sweat bullets in a 72 degree room. 

Im blessed. iv talked to my wife and shes an amazing source of support. But no one else knows. iv got a facade of normality I don't believe anyone sees through. I'm just looking to connect with other alcoholics.

What people don't realize is that normal, healthy, everyday people already unconsciously live by these steps. Think of it like wearing a pair of glasses.

When I survey my drinking days, I recall many people whom my life touched casually, but whose days I troubled through my anger and sarcasm.  These people are untraceable, and direct amends to them are not possible.  The only amends I can make to those untraceable individuals, the only 'changes for the better' I can offer, are indirect amends made to other people, whose paths briefly cross mine.  Courtesy and kindness, regularly practiced, help me to live in emotional balance, at peace with myself.

Despite struggling every day I have managed to quit for good this time.  For me, the toughest part has not been staying away from drinking but managing the symptoms that I have faced resulting from my drinking.  I suffered nearly 3-4 extremely difficult anxiety attacks for at least the first six weeks that I stopped drinking and still suffer from very difficult anxiety symptoms that are debilitating everyday.  What I believe to be the source of the anxiety is my stomach problems.  The brain and the gut are interconnected and anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with GI problems.  For the past nearly 90 days my abdomen is bloated, I have burning pain, I have difficulty swallowing, I belch every few minutes and my stools have been very small and inadequate.  I do not have gastritis or any structural problems so I do not know what the issue is.  My best guess is that my digestive system is all messed up and I am holding on to the small hope that it will hopefully go away in the next 1,2,3 months ahead or so.  My question for everyone is has anyone experienced abdominal issues and symptoms recovering from alcoholism that sound similar to mine?  Has anyone had those issues and/or anxiety symptoms?

I made awful, awful decisions, I burnt many, many bridges earlier this week on an alcoholic binge, openly exclaimed very private feelings to people I shouldn’t have (before blacking out). I made a complete fool of myself. This progression into a downward spiral, has disrupted everything.

Im retrospect, in the back of my head I knew I’d relapse weeks beforehand. I had a gut feeling to stay home that day instead of running errands, which I actively participated in ignoring. This disease, is progressive. I picked up exactly where I left off.

Even on attempted sober streaks, past memories resurface that I do the best to deal with. Now that I’ve created a whole new host of social, and personal issues, it’s back to square one and it’s overwhelming to think of facing a new day.

Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead...

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 83

The reconstruction of my life is the prime goal in my recovery as I avoid taking that first drink, one day at a time.  The task is most successfully accomplished by working the Steps of our Fellowship.  The spiritual life is not a theory; it works, but I have to live it.  Step Two started me on my journey to develop a spiritual life; Step Nine allows me to move into the final phase of the initial Steps which taught me how to live a spiritual life.  Without the guidance and strength of a Higher Power, it would be impossible to proceed through the various stages of reconstruction.  I realize that God works for me and through me.  Proof comes to me when I realize that God did for me what I could not do for myself, by removing that gnawing compulsion to drink.  I must continue daily to seek God's guidance.  He grants me a daily reprieve and will provide the power I need for reconstruction.

it started  years ago. at thirteen, i had my first drink. it was at a bar in tenerife and it was a couple beers. i was petite and young so the alcohol kicked in fast. it fucked me up. i dont remember anything but the feeling of being messed up felt so good. after that, i stopped drinking for 2 years because i was scared of alcohol. i didnt want to get fucked up again. but at 15 i was at a party and i had a sip of vodka and...needless to say, i went overboard and blacked out. i needed it to have fun. 

thats when it began. it started with just drinking with friends, then with the family, then on my own in my room. actually, i'm drinking right now in my room while i write this. i drink about 3-5 shots of vodka 3-4 times a week. i even find myself thinking about drinking if i'm sad. i do it at night alone in my room...it helps me sleep. if i dont drink at night i have suicidal thoughts and cant sleep.

you might be wondering---how can you afford all that booze?

well, my dad owns a bar in our backyard. i sneak out to it when my parents are out or asleep and take a bottle of vodka. my dad bulk buys booze so he doesnt notice. i have a stash in my room. one bottle lasts me about a four days and when i run out i just...make a trip to the bar. 

its either big or go home when i drink. i dont have a limit. i'll drink until i am literally blacking out choking on my own sick. 

i have mental health issues that have been discussed in therapy (went a few years ago because of a family issue) but no diagnosis came out of that. but pretty sure i have depression and anxiety--i dont need a expensive hour for a dickhead to tell me what is obvious.

anyway, i wanna talk to someone about this. i dont see many teenager alcholics.

We feel a man is unthinking when he says sobriety is enough

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 82

When I reflect on Step Nine, I see that physical sobriety must be enough for me.  I need to remember the hopelessness I felt before I found sobriety, and how I was willing to go to any lengths for it.  Physical sobriety is not enough for those around me, however, since I must see that God's gift is used to build a new life for my family and loved ones.  Just as importantly, I must be available to help others who want the A.A. way of life.  I ask God to help me share the gift of sobriety so that its benefits may be shown to those I know and love.

Gonna try to be brief.  I'm a dude in my late 20s.  I have been sober for a week and attended three meetings in total.  I have done a few AA/SMART meetings in the past, but was never really serious about it.  Have known I have a problem for several years but decided to kick the can down the road.  

Recently had a bad night and kinda said 'enough is enough' and realized I need to get this shit under control before I'm in my 50s wishing I had gotten it under control sooner.  

I am not looking to replace my alcoholism with AA.  I realize people gotta do what they gotta do to stay sober.   

--- 

**Day 1:** Go to a meeting.  Meet some people, chit-chat, yadda-yadda.  Dude 10 years my junior pulls me aside and starts preaching AA to me.  Okay, cool.  He's obviously stoked on the program, good for him.  I'm still feeling out the program and whether it fits.  We exchange numbers.  He tells me to come to a meeting tomorrow as well.  Really don't want to, but fuck it, stuff I've been doing hasn't been helping, so why not.  

**Day 2:**  Get a text at noon from this guy.  

&gt;""Call me when you get a chance.""  

I'm at work, and more importantly, **I do not know you.**  Get another call around 3.  Multiple text messages.  

&gt;""Where do you live? Do you need a ride?""  

End up going to the meeting, was decent.  At the end the guy pulls me aside and starts preaching AA again and how important sponsorship is, etc.  I set some boundaries with ""I'm not looking for that, I appreciate the extended offer, not looking to attend meetings every day"" (why the fuck am I explaining myself to this guy)?  But he continues on.  

**Day 3:** More texts and phone calls.  Blocked.  End of story.  

**Day 7:** See him at the meeting, exchange pleasantries.  No big deal.  End up sitting next to *another* guy that's about the same age as guy 1 who immediately gives me his phone and tells me to put my number in it.  Like a fucking idiot I do it.  

Meeting is alright, but I notice everyone who shares harps on the importance of a sponsor and how necessary it is to have one. 

At the end of the meeting the new guy approaches me with the same talking points as the first guy.  

Curious to see what tomorrow holds.  

--- 

&gt;Remember when I said I'll try to be brief?  

First things first, I'm not judging the program off of one overzealous, well-intentioned person.  That would be asinine.  I do not intend to drop meetings because of these interactions.  I decided to go to meetings of my own volition and I'll stop going to them the same way.   

However... I am *not* looking for a fellowship.  I am *not* looking for friends.  Doesn't mean I'm going to be an antisocial asshole at meetings either.  We're all there for the same reason and there's value in sharing experiences.  

From these meetings though, I'm noticing a pattern in how ""into"" AA everyone is.  Like people are stoked to the nth degree on the program.  They say the name ""Bill"" with revere.  

Is my addict brain looking for reasons to say ""fuck AA you don't need that""?  Of course it is.  I am fully aware of that, which is why I'm putting forth an effort to attend in spite of those feelings.  But hot-damn, it feels like there must be a sponsorship punch-card program where you get a free hat or something after you get 10 sponsees or something with the way everyone talks about it.  

---  

**In closing**:  Is this *normal* behavior?  It's hella off-putting and I feel like I'm being sold something which immediately raises red-flags for me.  Could just be the group dynamic, I don't know.  I'm really looking to use AA as a tool to achieve sobriety, not make it part of my identity.

The willingness to grow is the essence of all spiritual development.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 171

A line from a song goes, '... and I look to find a reason to believe...' It reminds me that at one time I was not able to find a reason to believe that my life was all right.  Even though my life had been saved by my coming to A.A., three months later I went out and drank again.  Someone told me: 'You don't have to believe.  Aren't you willing to believe that there is a reason for your life, even though you may not know yourself what that reason is, or that you may not sometimes know the right way to behave?'  When I saw how willing I was to believe there was a reason for my life, then I could start to work on the Steps.  Now when I begin with, 'I am willing...', I am using the key that leads to action, honesty, and an openness to a Higher Power moving through my life.

I’ve overcome a couple of hurdles so far this week but I’m not completely elated about it. Part of me feels the way I felt when I lost my smell/taste when I first got Covid, like a ghost. Just hovering along. 

My college offers free counseling to students. I’ve been meaning to reach out for over a year now but it’s so much easier penning a novel here than it is verbalize your feelings to a person in front of you. I’m worried about wasting my time with empty suggestions. I want that instant gratification, give me the answers, and fix me today counseling-which doesn’t exist. 

I have to say that when I woke up today, I had a clarity, energy level, and solid will to not drink today. The dealer I usually get c*ke from texts near daily messages to everyone he sells to say he’ll only be available certain times of the day. I texted him back thanking him for everything but that I’m making the personal decision to not buy anymore. It was the right thing to do, but doesn’t mean I can’t/won’t procure it through someone else when the desire rears its ugly head again. 

I’m almost 31. When I turned 30 I told myself, “okay, this is where you grow the fuck up”, yet I kept doing the same old things because they were cozy. The most recent cozy things being getting off of work, going to a bar and having a few, then going home and having more, and using some of the bag, if I had one, to keep a chilled elevation. I’d clean the house and dance around, slump on the couch and surf the internet on the phone while tv is running and repeat. How the hell was that in any way amusing, lol? Now, with new introspective eyes, I have two more months until my birthday to really impress myself. It’s really not about a deadline but it would mean something to me to do this. If I want to succeed and get into this program at school, be part of the medical field, and assist in saving lives I really need and be that person now. 

For most of the day I’ve been daydreaming about that refreshing first sip of a beer and then the wave of relaxation from said beer. Monday, my friend (who I pretty much solely drink and do blow with) and I plan to go hiking. We are both dying for nature and fresh air and something that doesn’t require alcohol, but honestly (I know this is mean) it’s the only way I can tolerate her most times. We can have good conversation that way, otherwise she babbles and it makes me want to run into a wall. There’s a lodge restaurant up where we want to hike, and it’s got a bar. I’ve relayed, in my mind, celebrating with a drink to commemorate going a week without drinking like 100 times now. It seems like the ultimate day-nature and hops. I hope I’m strong enough to not want to give in after the hike. Or at the very least maybe I have one and I’m done and I don’t repeat patterns of yesterday.

If more gifts are to be received, our awakening has to go on.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 8

Sobriety fills the painful 'hole in the soul' that my alcoholism created.  Often I feel so physically well that I believe my work is done.  However, joy is not just the absence of pain; it is the gift of continued spiritual awakening.  Joy comes from ongoing and active study, as well as application of the principles of recovery in my everyday life, and from sharing that experience with others.  My Higher Power presents many opportunities for deeper spiritual awakening.  I need only to bring into my recovery the willingness to grow.  Today I am ready to grow.

And I just said you need to get up and let her get down from the lounge. Well he lost his fucking shit screamed at me, I said some things back in the heat of the moment. I expected it to be over after that, however it just carried on all night, with him telling my mum he’s never speaking to me again. And I need to get the fuxk out of his house.

I’ve been using heavily both substances for 8 years. And this is the first time I’ve been completely sober in that time. I went to the drs today and I wanted to get a psychiatrist referral, which I had discussed with her the day before on a phone consult. however I was really anxious at the in person appointment today and found it hard to state exactly what I needed. It was a shambles of a dr appointment. I ended up leaving empty handed and she assessed me for having no depression or anxiety, despite knowing that the last 3 weeks for me have been spent in bed watching Netflix, zero motivation and barely showering or functioning. I want to see a psychiatrist as I’m 100% sure that I have something more than depression and anxiety. However after I left I suspected she thought I was seeking drugs... even though I asked for nothing but did tell her how bad my sleep has been. I haven’t slept for over 40 hrs now, as the appointment was early and I’ve been up till like 10am most mornings then sleeping through the day. I thought I would sleep tonight but after previously mentioned events I’m really wired and anxious and just have a tonne of thoughts rushing through my mind and I’ve been so emotional tonight. Feeling things I haven’t felt in 8 years. So horrible fucking day and night for me. Just feeling really unsettled upset and I really can’t deal with these feelings. Also have probably ruined my sobriety has I took 4 panedeine fortes (which my parents have an absolute duck tonne of all prescribed) to try and sleep and as per usual (I’ve tried every possible OTC sleeping pill) nothing is working and I’m just so over this not sleeping business. It’s killing me. No desire to drink tho.... just to sleep. Thanks for listening. Also fml

Alcoholics Anonymous will never have a professional class.  We have gained some understanding of the ancient words 'Freely ye have received, freely give.'  We have discovered that at the point of professionalism, money and spirituality do not mix.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 166

I believe that Alcoholics Anonymous stands alone in the treatment of alcoholism because it is based solely on the principle of one alcoholic sharing with another alcoholic.  This is what makes the program unique.  When I decided that I wanted to stay sober, I called a woman who I knew was a sober member of A.A., and she carried the message of Alcoholics Anonymous to me.  She received no monetary compensation, but rather was paid by staying sober another day herself.  Today I could ask for no payment other than another day free from alcohol, so in that respect, I am generously paid for my labor.

After I started making good money I got into wine and whiskey, started binging them hard every night,
blackouts, that sort of thing. After a few months I got “smarter” about my drinking, and my tolerance rose as I learned to keep my intoxication at a certain level. Rarely hungover, rarely had those ugly gaps of “how much did I drink last night”.

Of course after that it started to become the default state not just for evenings but weekends in general, then a drink in the morning to loosen up before work, then drinking through the work day, almost never getting drunk enough to have it pass an enjoyable “buzz”. 

A drink to unwind, to calm the nerves, to pass the time bored, to make a fun time more fun, till now four years in I realised I can’t function without it.

I don’t even think I want to be forever 100% alcohol free but I need to break alcohol being a part of my regular life and not just a treat at social encounters for at least a few months but it’s like this naked feeling without it already. 

My mind is already trying to make excuses, “just one every other day” and shit like that like I don’t feel like I’ve been increasingly living in a haze for the past few years.

I kept joking with friends that I was a functioning alcoholic because by all accounts my life was well functioning; good job, relationships all well maintained, but I feel like I was just gradually losing the plot, feeling less motivated, more unhealthy, and that if I didn’t stop I would one day not wake up from this.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37132,public,self,Day 2 of ???,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pex2ev/day_2_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

IG has long been my social media vice, and I’ve drawn a lot of inspiration and gratification from it but it has been toxic as well. It’s where I put my FBI creeper skills to “use” and endlessly scan things I know are detrimental to my mental health. I’m pleased with this development, and I don’t really have the desire to reactive just yet. This is the same mindset I want with drinking. If you read my other posts, you’ll see that I plan on at least week break from the bev. 
It’s day 2 and I’m struggling. 

The last time I took a “break” from drinking was when I was quarantined from my boyfriend in the same house due to Covid in early May. I was diluting my body with water rather than beer and after 3/4 days of painful boredom, I said screw it-I’m drinking. Not because I felt the urge but because I wanted to feel something and occupy time.
Fast forward to present day and I have chest tightness just from trying to not think about drinking. It doesn’t seem fair to actively try to do better but still be possessed by this feeling. I’m constantly reading all of your Day 10s, Day 35s, Day 1000s, and I know it’s possible, I just need to get past the irritable parts. 

On a good note, yesterday I went to the plant shop to buy my boyfriend a gift for moving up in his job. I ended up getting one for myself as well. I think plants add beauty and a sense of duty to a home. I actually kind of wanted the plant I got him for myself as a secret way to track my progress in this journey. ‘Pothos’ are those unmistakable vine-y green leafed plants you’ve probably seen in at least one house growing up. They grow very quickly and before you know it you have an elegant, cascading decoration that you grew and took care of. I wanted to suggest that to anyone that’s trying out sobriety and an unconventional way of tracking it? If you’re curious about what I got myself, it makes more sense for my present situation; Google ‘fishbone cactus’ haha.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37130,public,self,Progress with a dash of pain,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pew753/progress_with_a_dash_of_pain/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been on a weekend away with a friend and enjoyed non-alcoholic drinks. I went out for my birthday and enjoyed virgin cocktails. I was starting to feel very empowered like I wasn't going to really miss out. I felt the full support of friends and I was relieved that they weren't treating me any differently. We swapped stories about travel plans, a passion we all share, and a friend asked me if I was interested in joining in on a trip. We have travelled together multiple times over 15 years of friendship. But when I contacted her to ask about specifics, she told me that she'd had second thoughts. That the trip wasn't for me. That she felt like there would be a lot of partying and she felt that I shouldn't come. To be honest, I felt so heartbroken and ashamed. Like a person that couldn't be trusted. That was being babied and infantalized. Or that I wasn't fun anymore and would ruin their trip because of my sobriety. I've been so low and on the verge of tears all evening. Has anyone had a similar experience? This is a friend who I trusted enough to talk about my sobriety and I feel like it's been thrown back in my face. I feel so pathetic and embarrassed. It's been a lonely year and it took a lot for me to accept this invite. It's my birthday tomorrow and I just want to hide from everyone. Like everyone is judging me. To be clear, my problem is not a daily thing. It is a binging problem, so I'm fine as long as I don't pick up that first drink. I can tolerate people drinking around me perfectly fine. I actually like that I can be there for them and drive them home. But all my positive feelings about my choice are giving way to shame, and I feel so alienated from my friends. It's like I'm being punished and excluded for making a positive choice for myself, one that doesn't impact them at all. I just don't get it.

I was a bit eager to get home because I had, to my memory, a 1/4 bag of c*ke from my last purchase left somewhere near or on my wicker side drawer. Standard “this is the last time before I take a break or quit” internal monologue. 

When I got home I almost already had the zing I was looking for from that bag because I knew I’d walk straight to where I last put it and dive in so I could finally be rid of it, but it wasn’t there. I uprooted that general area in disbelief-I don’t lose bags. I managed to breathe and let it go for the night, but the addict mentality definitely lingered until the next day. I still want it, really bad.  It would have been fairly easy to call the right person up and fork the money out but I didn’t, and for that I will be proud. I don’t consider myself addicted to c*ke, but I’ve been pairing it with alcohol for so long, it’s like best friends not hanging out at their favorite spot anymore, so I don’t separate them if I don’t have to. I’m typing this all out because this needs to be a part of my online accountability that I’ve come to enjoy and look forward to these last couple of days. 

Before that day materialized, I was having a slow day at work when a certain celebrity and his wife came in my section to eat. I immediately knew who he was and got heart palpitations. It was weird that they were there, a nice but meager chain restaurant. Shortly after sitting down , they said they had to leave because their hotel room opened up, and politely said bye. The rest of the day that excitement turned into wanting a drink. I was watching this all happen kind outside myself, like whoa dude…if there ever was a marker for your personal problem, here it is. 

Work is getting slower with the school months and COVID and that makes me worry about money, even though I’m living with my boyfriend and am not expected to pay anything besides the electric bill. I have it good. With this extra time, there’s also a fridge full of beer and white claw beckoning my name in the back room. Most of you may say throw it out, and that would be wise but it’s not even my drink of choice and I’m the type of person that likes to leave and be out of my personal space when I drink.

In the Fellowship I didn't have to make promises, I didn't have to concentrate.  It only required my attending one meeting, in a foggy condition, to know I was home.  I didn't have to pledge undying love.  Here, strangers hugged me. 'It gets better,' they said, and 'One day at a time, you can do it.'  They were no longer strangers, but caring friends.  I ask God to help me to reach out to people desiring sobriety, and to, please, keep me grateful!

New to reddit even though I've had this account for a couple years now, I don't even know if this is the place to tell my story I just feel like typing and needed somewhere to do it, I will sum it up for most part skipping a lot of minor details.

where to start

I grew up in a family of drinkers and I always told myself as a kid I would never drink.

I turned 13 and needless to say I tried my first drink and got my first buzz, it was amazing. the next day my father passed away due to heavy drinking for many years. I thought I was being punished by god for drinking so I swore it off for good, Until of course I turned 16 and the parties started in school. I met a girl and we dated for about 2.5 years until she realized I couldn't hold a job down because I was either too hungover or would just rather party

as the years went on I became a party animal, I lived off of FOMO (Fear of missing out) so I would never miss a house party at any cost. It got so bad I didn't even graduate high school as I was basically homeless by choice after my father passed away because I just couldn't be at home. 

more years passed and I entered my 20's going to clubs and bars every weekend and drinking very seldom during the week, I met a girl who I dated for about 5 years (started dating when we were 19) and again after years of not being able to hold a job longer then a year she had enough and we separated and I was an absolute wreck so of course I went on a bender for about a year but at this point I was still in control of my drinking, I could say no if I needed to. I was on and off working in the oil patch making good money if you're curious how I could afford to drink so much and I managed to put money away.

I was quite independent for the most part throughout the years, for instance, finding my own places to live, financing my first vehicle things of that sort, basic shit, things a normal human being should do.

Closing in on my 26th birthday I moved provinces to visit my mother, I had moved out of my own place and virtually had no home but staying with her wasn't an issue at all, I figured I'd figure it out, find a new job and get a place, well, that's where things really started to go down hill. I was jobless, on unemployment payments and I found myself with nothing to do but go to the gym, play video games and drink so, that's what I did and life at the time was GREAT! I was free and basically feeling like I was on an extended vacation. Instead of finding a job I tried to start my own business online and was determined to make it succeed so after drinking more and more steadily day after day burning through my saving I ended up relying on my mother to support my habit. This went on for about 3 or so years. Single. not a care in the world. thinking I'll succeed eventually but due to my drinking things as I'm sure you guessed it did not go well. After years of working my way up from a 6 pack of beer a night to 26+ ounces of straight vodka a day I found myself in hospital on my way to my first detox. To put it bluntly this also continued for a LONG TIME, years. I couldn't count how many detox centers I've been to on both hands, easily 12 or more. I've always had the mindset of I don't need rehab I can do this on my own I know I can but I couldn't obviously

I finally caved and went to stay with my sister back in the same province I originally came from in hopes of a new life as her and her husband were not drinkers, and it worked! I reconnected with the most beautiful woman I could ever dream of that I knew from high school. beautiful in the sense of inside and out. She was independent, owned her own home, had a great career a dog the whole package. WE HAD A BLAST together, I'm tearing up just thinking about it. I HAD HOPE! I thought this is it, I'm gonna start a new life, a REAL life, one with promise and success....BUT

I messed up.... again. I started drinking and showed my true self to the first woman I've loved in years, I fell for this girl so hard my mind is spinning just thinking of her, my guts turn. I got into it so bad that another ambulance was called for me in order to basically keep me alive. I had not been able to stop drinking. I had consumed so much alcohol doctors were surprised I was alive and of course. she left. I mean why would she stay. not only that but my sister, one of the only places I had to live kicked me from her home. luckily I had a brother who's spare bedroom I'm sitting in right now writing this.

IM BROKE. I've lost my money including my investments due to taking them out and burning them on drinking, I've lost my home, the trust of all my friends, siblings and even my mother, I don't have a career let alone a job, I've recently come out of ANOTHER detox center and I've ONCE AGAIN lost the love of my life all by the age of 31

I've heard of depression and people struggling with it, I've read stories and thought at times I might be depressed throughout my life but no.. I truly wasn't I was just sad, melancholic perhaps. I've always dealt with anxiety but this..... this feeling of complete emptiness, sheer hopelessness, staring off into the distance with the thought of will I even wake up in the morning and would it matter, I can't even begin to explain the pain in my heart and soul, a pain I've never experienced in my life. I'm afraid, I don't sleep I can't eat I'm starting to not even remember things because I'm in such a fog of self despair I just.... I don't even know what to say from here. The things I'm experiencing are things I've only ever witnessed in movies, Horrors movies

1. We SURRENDER TO WIN. On the face of it, surrendering certainly does not seem like winning. But it is in A.A. Only after we have come to the end of our rope, hit a stone wall in some aspect of our lives beyond which we can go no further; only when we hit “bottom” in despair and surrender, can we accomplish sobriety which we could never accomplish before. We must, and we do, surrender in order to win.

2. We GIVE AWAY TO KEEP. That seems absurd and untrue. How can you keep anything if you give it away? But in order to keep whatever it is we get in A.A., we must go about giving it away to others, for no fees or rewards of any kind. When we cannot afford to give away what we have received so freely in A.A., we had better get ready for our next “drunk.” It will happen every time. We’ve got to continue to give it away in order to keep it.

3. We SUFFER TO GET WELL. There is no way to escape the terrible suffering of remorse and regret and shame and embarrassment which starts us on the road to getting well from our affliction. There is no new way to shake out a hangover. It’s painful. And for us, necessarily so. I told this to a friend of mine as he sat weaving to and fro on the side of the bed, in terrible shape, about to die for some paraldehyde. I said, “Lost John”—that’s his nickname—”Lost John, you know you’re going to have to do a certain amount of shaking sooner or later.” “Well,” he said, “for God’s sake let’s make it later!” We suffer to get well.

4. We DIE TO LIVE. That is a beautiful paradox straight out of the Biblical idea of being “born again” or “losing one’s life to find it.” When we work at our Twelve Steps, the old life of guzzling and fuzzy thinking, and all that goes with it, gradually dies, and we acquire a different and a better way of life. As our shortcomings are removed, one life of us dies, and another life of us lives. We in A.A. die to live.

I’m 30/f, and a self-diagnosed alcoholic. I think the only adult-like thing I’ve done with this predicament is admit that to myself. Gone are the days where an alcoholic is just a middle-aged man in a suit and tie drinking Manhattans by 9am, we’re different shades and flavors now-which, honestly is probably more interesting too. I live in Las Vegas, where this stuff is basically thrown at you, literally, depending on your profession. I’m a food server and pre-COVID, when I worked nights, alcohol was practically my bottle of milk, cocaine to help stay up and enjoy it more and get home “safely”.

I'm very new to this so I thought I'd start by giving a bit of a background...

I started drinking when I was about 10 years old when me and a buddy found my parents liquor cabinet, after that it was game over. I was drinking copious amounts of vodka and filling the bottle up with water thinking my parents wouldn't notice, etc etc. By the time I got to high-school I was sneaking liquor into school every day. I went to college and it got worse, I got to a point where I was drinking a liter of booze a day... and somehow I graduated with an engineering degree.

Anyways, I've been feeling alot better about my habits recently and have been able to keep it somewhat in control.  Playing guitar has been the best escape for me, but sometimes even listening to certain music triggers me into falling back into horrible habits.

We are sure that humility, expressed by anonymity, is the greatest safeguard that Alcoholics Anonymous can ever have.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 187

Since there are no rules in A.A. I place myself where I want to be, and so I choose anonymity.  I want my God to use me, humbly, as one of His tools in this program.  Sacrifice is the art of giving of myself freely, allowing humility to replace my ego.  With sobriety, I suppress that urge to cry out to the world, 'I am a member of A.A.' and I experience inner joy and peace.  I let people see the changes in me and hope they will ask what happened to me.  I place the principles of spirituality ahead of judging, fault-finding, and criticism.  I want love and caring in my group, so I can grow.

There seems to be a large number of preachy, judgmental people that have presumably been sober for years that seem to intention seek out newcomers and tear them down. Not sure if it makes them feel superior because they have 20, 30 years under their belt, or what. But I feel we have to remember that no matter where we are in our journey, we all started exactly the same. Whether we're a day sober or 10 years, no one should feel superior or inferior to anyone. 

This leads me to my next point. I've seen a lot of people on this Sub comment that AA seems like a cult. I don't believe it's a cult and I do plan to go to my first meeting in awhile this Tuesday at my local church. But I understand and accept that it's not for everyone. If someone is an atheist or just doesn't like the group setting they shouldn't feel pressured to join AA. I know tons of people that got sober without AA. It's not the one and only solution to sobriety. Don't try to shove it down someone's throat if it's just not their cup of tea. 

CONTEXT: this has happened three times now and I actually had to block a fellow Redditor for just being a combative, argumentative jerk. For context, I decided to quit drinking on Thursday the 12th. That Sunday I had a massive gallbladder attack (very severe pain, 10/10 EASILY) that landed me in the E.R. Turns out a stone was blocking my bile duct and it needed to be removed immediately. I had my entire gallbladder removed that Tuesday. I was stuck in the hospital for 2 days. Due to the covid surge I couldn't even get my own room. I was stuck in the E.R. for 2 days. I wasn't allowed visitors. My phone died. No TV (obviously). The doctors also talked to me about my alcoholism and detoxed me. I was all alone with just my thoughts. It very much felt like an inpatient rehab. The doctors scared me straight and told me I'd have liver cancer and failure in 10 years if I don't stop. It was my rock bottom. Not to mention my current boyfriend almost left me right before my hospitalization due to my drinking. My life was basically threatening to fall apart. This just cemented the fact I no longer have a choice. I HAVE to quit. 

I've quit cold turkey before. Without rehab. I went 9 months without booze when I was pregnant with my daughter who is now going on 3. I probably had the strength to not start up again but sadly I did. I went through a lot of trauma with my ex husband and the divorce from hell that caused me to start drinking again. I've quit for months at a time in the past 3 years, but this cycle seemed unbreakable. I've been seeing a therapist regularly every other week, but to ensure I don't go back to that darkness I plan to go to AA. My first meeting is this Tuesday and I even have a friend going with me to hold me accountable. 

But this isn't good enough for some of the snobs on this Sub. I've been asked by THREE different people why I've waited two weeks to go to a meeting. They've insinuated I'm ""making excuses"" or I ""don't really want to quit drinking"". I even got told by one person that I'll NOT go to this week's meeting and postpone and postpone. This is simply not true. And 2 out of 3 people backed off when I explained that I just had a MAJOR surgery. I've been given 2 weeks off work (actually the doctor added a few more days because I was recovering SLOWER than expected). I could not sit up straight or even walk without intense pain up until yesterday. I was doped up on various meds which I've only been able to cut down on in the past couple days. I made plans to go to an AA meeting once I PHYSICALLY felt up to it. But this one rude guy kept insinuating I was making excuses and not ready to quit. Um, I've gone 2 weeks and 2 days without it and I already made plans to go to a meeting this Tuesday based on my physical ability to manage my current pain threshold. But I think this guy was projecting or just wanting to argue. 

Clearly these people have never had a major surgery like having an organ removed. Like what, should I have asked my local church to host the AA meeting in the post-op unit of the hospital?

I don't know. It just makes me mad that I'm sitting here trying to recover and people are jumping down my throat. I'm not even allowed to lift my own toddler for another 2 weeks, and have temporarily moved back in with my parents for help with her because my boyfriend works crazy hours. My parents have been supportive and held me accountable too. I voluntarily surrendered my ID to my boyfriend to remove all temptation and my parents have gotten rid of all alcohol in their house as well. So I have a strong support system.

It should be respected that it's not everyone's cup of tea and different things work for different people.

That's was more than 2 years ago.

Today, I'm working with a dear friend in very early sobriety.  Just after returning home from an AA meeting last night, their spouse was drunk - angry drunk, and started throwing furniture onto the lawn.  They're young child was there and the home was filled with fright.  It reminded me this hateful disease of alcoholism is still at large.  Ruining families and breaking the hearts of children.  It seems hopeless, but my own early sobriety had similar challenges.  Change is hard, and scary sometimes for those around us, especially a spouse who also drinks.

I persisted with my AA program regardless of how troubling things got at home, going to meetings nearly every day and talking with my sponsor.  I couldn't solve the problem that my spouse was going to keep drinking, sometimes in my face, but my Higher Power could!!!  I had no idea it was coming.  About a year into my sobriety my spouse said, ""I'm done with drinking"" and walked away from it.  We don't fight over nonsense anymore.  My kids don't say, ""Please, stop fighting, go to bed!  Your just saying the same things over and over and it doesn't even make any sense.""  We're still together and it's a happy home on a regular basis. 

I'm grateful for the program and for the people here that taught me how to live sober, without the crutch of a drink.

But today the cravings are back. First time having cravings since this whole thing started. So I have ordered non-alcoholic beer. I've heard mixed opinions about this.

Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then.

I live in Lebanon and we only have one group, and as fate would have it it was a 10 minute walk away. I went religiously for a year and a half and took up a service position and couldn't believe the changes in me, neither could my friends and family. So, covid happened and I lost my business and all my money, that took a huge toll on my marriage which ended last year after we were both affected by a massive explosion that destroyed half Beirut, the flat I was in was literally blown up and I walked away with a few stitches. Now 5 years ago, any one of those would have had me binging for weeks, all together I probably would have died of alcohol poisoning. And throughout everything, two things an old timer always stuck in my head. Think it through, and if it's totally out of control how is alcohol possibly help. 
So my point is, life is random and can be very hard, and we have to accept life on lifes terms, but as alcoholics that is never ever going to be a solution.

So for background I'm 25/female from the UK. I've been a secret binge drinker for the last 3 years, my family and boyfriend have no idea about my problem. I was drinking 3-4 bottles of wine across the week, almost always on an empty stomach to get drunk fast. The thing is I've now gotten some form of ""control"" over it and now only have 2-3 drinks across the whole week, usually a large glass of wine but again always on an empty stomach. 

I still feel like I have a problem though and can't kick the habit for good no matter how hard I try. I've had breaks of a month here and there and I always feel better but then eventually a life event happens (good or bad) that triggers the desire to have a drink again. Even just after one drink I feel woozy for the rest of the night and get aches/cramps/stabbing sensations around my liver and always have a mild hangover the next day. It makes me feel like shit but I can't stop this cycle of yo-yo sobriety and drinking. 

Even though I know I'll never go back to my old days of heavy drinking I still want to find the strength to quit for good to stop the anxiety that I'm damaging my liver. Like I said my loved ones have no idea so I can't talk to them, I'm contemplating getting professional help but I'd want it to be discrete as I don't want anyone finding out about it.

I will center my thoughts on a Higher Power.  I will surrender all to this power within me.  I will become a soldier for this power, feeling the might of the spiritual army as it exists in my life today.  I will allow a wave of spiritual union to connect me through my gratitude, obedience and discipline to this Higher Power.  Let me allow this power to lead me through the orders of the day.  May the steps I take today strengthen my words and deeds, may I know that the message I carry is mine to share, given freely by this power greater than myself.

Hate being here on this fucking planet. Have for as long as I can remember which I guess is why I started drinking all the time, doing heaps of drugs, and cutting myself. Did it help? No, not really. But it did pass the time. Made me feel like I could see myself just waiting to die rather than feeling like I was always a month or two away from killing myself.

But now I’ve stopped all that shit. Haven’t done drugs for about 6 months. Haven’t self-harmed for 4. Haven’t had any alcohol for 3. Did it cause it’s all you fucking hear as an addict, shit like “you gotta stop, you’ll feel so much better!”, and “you’ll never get where you need to be while you’re doing that shit!”. And maybe it’s even true in some cases.

Think the thing people forget is, I did that shit because I hate being alive. Suicide didn’t just feel like it was in the cards, it felt like it was the whole fucking deck. Like my next draw was it, I could delay it, but it was fucking inevitable. 

The therapists couldn’t help. Not DBT or CBT or EMDR or fucking any of them. It was all just fucking words at the end of the day. I’d take the suggestions, journaling, meditation, breathing exercises, the fucking mindfulness and practice ‘em, I mean really try, for at least a month, but still, sweet fuck all in the results column. 

Pills were the same. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, didn’t fucking matter. When through dozens and dozens of the fucking things. None of them did anything, not a fucking thing. Not even one pesky fucking side effects. Zilch.  

So then I started self-medicating. Maybe it’s just cause I was so fucking numb all the time I just couldn’t tell how much I was suffering but I felt better. At least in ways. Didn’t have relationships to ruin, and for sure didn’t start new ones, but I could at least tolerate talking to people. Could tolerate being at work, can’t do that normally. Shame it’s hard to go unnoticed doing that shit at work though so I still couldn’t *hold* a job. Made a couple things better at least.

But then I stopped. Cause people I used to know told me I should. Only they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed. Then I stopped again cause those fucking people have instilled their fucking ideas in my head now and I can’t escape the fucking guilt and shame anymore and addiction is basically ruined for me. Thanks, fuckers.

But now I’m worse than ever. The medication still doesn’t do a fucking thing. Therapy is still just fucking useless words. Everything still fucking sucks and I still think about killing myself 24/7. Still exercise everyday, eat well, try to do shit, but it doesn’t fucking help one iota. And now one of my only options, becoming an addict to numb it all away, is gone cause of the fucking guilt. 

And the fucking therapists and shit just pat you on the back and tell you how fucking “proud” you should be for kicking the addictions. Like it fucking matters. Like them being proud translates to you in any fucking way. Like you don’t constantly wish you could throw the guilt away and go right back to it. Like it’s made any fucking difference in your life whatso-fucking-ever. They just act like you made it through hell when in reality, you’re caught in the worst fucking hell yet. And then they dust off their fucking hands and act like the hard works all done, at least the bulk of it. But it fucking isn’t. Feels like I’ve lost ground, like I’m a few steps *before* square one now. 

I just fucking hate this shit. I don’t understand what my brain is fucking waiting for by not letting my just up and kill myself. I don’t know why the fuck I can’t do it when it’s all I wanna do, when I don’t have any fucking hope and I don’t fucking care if it’ll “get better one day”.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,37047,public,self,Why kicking my addictions doesn’t fucking matter,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/pciufi/why_kicking_my_addictions_doesnt_fucking_matter/,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those words, for me, refer to a transference of power, through which God, as I understand Him, enters my life.  Through prayer and meditation, I open channels, then I establish and improve my conscious contact with God.  Through action I then receive the power I need to maintain my sobriety each day.  By maintaining my spiritual condition, by giving away what has been so freely given to me, I am granted a daily reprieve.

All the meetings I go to are at the same club at about the same time. I’ve been going there consistently for almost three months now. Because of this, I often run into the same people and I’ve gotten to know the people at my meetings really well and have already made some good sober friends. About a month in, I developed a crush on a long time member of the club with over 20 years of sobriety. I made a move and we ended up hitting it off instantly. We started hooking up every week or so. It was great except I found myself becoming a lot more self-conscious about my appearance at meetings than I was before we started hooking. I got a little too focused on making sure I looked attractive to him at every meeting that it really started to distract me from the purpose of why I was there in the first place. Then I started to wonder if other people in the meeting noticed I was trying to put my effort into my appearance and that made me self-conscious as well. On top of that, I am friends with a really beautiful young woman about my age who obviously gets a lot of attention at the club and the guy I’ve been talking to has admitted he finds her really attractive. They are also good friends and I find myself getting really jealous whenever he’s near her or talking to her. It’s like the feeling of jealousy comes on so quickly and aggressively I can’t even process it and I’m just instantly seeing red. I hate that I feel this way because she’s a really sweet girl who’s earnestly trying to work the program. She’s also just going through a lot. We should be on the same team supporting each other especially because our sobriety dates are so close and I feel awful about these jealous feelings. I just constantly find myself comparing myself to her. These feelings got so overwhelming one night, I found myself leaving a function early when I saw the two of them sitting together. I decided after that point that I needed a break from meetings at that club. I promised myself I’d keep up with meetings and find other places to go but I’ve fallen off severely and I know that’s putting my sobriety in danger. This club just became a default place and safe space. When I didn’t know where to go or what to do I went there and could always find someone to talk to. Now I’m so afraid and anxious to start up meetings there again. I’ve changed my appearance drastically (I shaved the side of my head to support a co-worker undergoing a brain surgery) and now I’m really worried this guy won’t find me attractive if he sees me. But I also feel like by not going to the meetings, I’m losing so much of the social support and connections  I’ve built up over the last few months. Not sure what to do. Idk if my anxiety will let me show my face at a meeting there for a while. I’ve been telling myself I’ll feel more confident going to a meeting there after I’ve lost 15 more pounds  (I know sounds ridiculous). 
Yes, I have a sponsor and she was supportive of my decision to take a break from meetings there but she also really wanted me to stay on top of my meetings if I were to go elsewhere and I haven’t to be honest.

Because of this, I would basically ruin all my friendships and relationships, out of revenge for small things they'd done to me, I got back at them by doing worse.

He goes through phases of being sober. When he's sober, he'd hold down a job for months and suddenly, he'd disappear and use the money he makes for binging on alcohol. We wouldn't know about him quitting/getting fired until his employer would call us letting us know he 1) no showed for work for days, 2) them checking up on him because he said he was ""sick"", or 3) he stole from the register/arrived drunk and they've fired him.

Over the past few years however, he's become more aggressive and violent towards us whenever he drinks (we are an Asian household and it's common for us to still live under the same roof until we get married, etc so we see all of this happening).He gets especially aggressive towards my mom because she would try to stop him from walking out and going to the liquor store. He's shoved, pushed, and knocked her down before when she tried to get in his way. My mom is 4'8, no more than 90lbs who tries to go up against my brother who's 5'7 over 200lbs. She's ended up with bruises and bloodied parts because of it. I've been knocked down unconscious before because I've gotten in the way between them as he was about to strike her. We live in a gated community and on several occasions, he's tried to break into our neighbors' homes, has blacked out in front of our house/the nearby community park and the cops would show up to either tell him to go home or take him away for overnight jail time. He's also been to the hospital several times and can go MIA for months until he'd show up on our doorstep randomly.

My brother is currently in his drunk phase after being sober for months. My sister and I have always told him that we wouldn't let him in the house when he's drunk and we've stuck by this rule for years. But my mom will always bring him food and water and has snuck him in the house before so that he could use the bathroom/shower when we're not home/away at work. We've told her that every time she does this, she helps enable his behavior because she's always there to cushion his fall.

My brother can be such a wonderful and smart guy, but when he's drunk, he can be the most reckless, selfish, violent person. It literally feels like a flip switch when he's sober and kind as opposed to when he's drunk and unruly. I'm extremely afraid of my mom getting hurt, especially with her being so small and frail. I really don't know what to do. Of course I've offered to take him to AA, attend it with him, offer to pay and take him to rehab, I feel like I've done and offered all that I can to help him but he has never accepted it. And we would threaten to call the cops on him when things got really bad, but my mom would lash out on my sister and I because she thinks of it as us turning our backs on him.

Can anyone please help give me any advice on what I should do? To either help my brother or confront my mom?

I'm really struggling and thought I can post here. I had 14 months of sobriety and I relapsed on August 13th. Since that day I have been drinking two bottles of wine a night. I hate myself. All my anxiety and depression returned in full force. 

For context, I am only child from a family who is extremely emotionally abusive. They can never love me for me and always want me to change myself. I just feel absolutely incapable of making any good thing come from my life. They constantly tell me that I am disgusting and they don't know what they did in their life to deserve a kid like me and that I cause them so much pain and they want to die because of me. This is primarily the reason why I started drinking again. I just couldn't handle the pain and sense of overwhelming fear that I would never be able to live up to their expectations and that I would be a failure. 

For the last few days, my drinking quickly escalated. I was drinking the wine and couldn't control any of my emotions anymore. I was sobbing to anyone who would listen. Now I am extremely embarrassed because I seem like a freaking mess. I'm scared that I would be judged and that I would be disliked by the people around me. 

My family also realized that I relapsed and now they are saying that they will not survive me putting them through this constant agony. 

I want to stay sober. I want to pull myself out before I sink further, but I have so much fear. I am so scared that things will not be ok and I am scared to face the pain. I got so anxious about the relapses and being so openly not ok in front of people. I hope that I haven't blown it with them and I hope that I can get better and show up for others like they have for me.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 63

Many times in my alcoholic state, I drank to establish a bond between myself and others, but I succeeded only in establishing the bondage of alcoholic loneliness.  Through the A.A. way of life, I have received the gift of bonding - with those who were there before me, with those who are there now, and with those yet to come.  For this gracious gift from God, I am forever grateful.

You then have to trust those people again and even more so when you tell them your life is doing better. Because to do better there must have been bad to begin with. To make things better you have to do something positive. 

Everyone here today is having a positive effect on everyone else present. Whether you speak or not. You are all equally important. We are all here for our combined issues with alcohol and through each person speaking, through every story shared, through every little smile, whether seen or unseen, we are helping each other heal a little at a time. 

I heard an interesting thing the other day that made me think a little harder than I normally would. And it's this: ""Who we are right now often seems to be the most important thing. Its not. What's important is who we can become."" 

As alcoholics we often think selfishly. It's always me, me ,me. And yet within that me me me mentality there is still a sense of community. A community of voices all speaking at once inside our heads. Will I have a drink tomorrow? Do I have enough money to drink tomorrow? Will I go to the shop early or maybe later in the day when the hangover wears off a little. Do I buy extra so I don't have to go out again the day after? These are all questions I would quietly ask myself every single time I had a few days off between work. It was always a conversation to myself. No one but me.

But even as selfish as those thoughts were. It was still community that we all have within us. A different level of thinking that goes beyond the present and the selfish here and now. We all think about tomorrow, the day after that, next week, next month, and next year. 
It is hard to say this and I'm sure I'm not the only one who at one point in time accepted that there would be no tomorrow. At some point in life we would be left alone, cold and bitter but it would be alright because alcohol would always be there as a companion. A companion that can't buy happiness, only rent it, but it will always be there as a way to climb out of hell. Or more honestly, to fall deeper into it. 

But thankfully, what I have come to realise over the last few months, is that ultimately, we have control. Looking back I often drank because the world around me was too busy, too loud, too chaotic. I grew up too quick and unaware to me, I drank to drown out the stress, the pain and the hurt that life threw at me. And at some point, what started as a coping mechanism became an addiction. And that addiction rapidly grew into a powerful demon. And I gladly called on that demon for over a decade to help deal with lifes struggles. 

And yes my demon and I had fun together. It would be a lie if I said it wasn't fun sometimes. I could tell you all stories that would make you laugh and smile and the majority all start with a drink. But that's the worst part. Those stories almost always start with a drink. The truth is I had an abusive relationship with the devil that is addiction. 

But at some point, all bad relationships face a fork in the road. We all have a choice as to where that road leads, and I have made my choice. I choose to live, free and happy. Despite a few setbacks, and more than a few bumps in the road, I am in control of my own destiny. Sure, I can choose to let this poison that is addiction continue to dominate who I am. Or I can fight back for the little community that lives inside me. The good selfless side that I ignored for so long. The one that tells me to be a little kinder to people despite how they treat me. Because maybe they are having a bad day? Maybe I can clean up after dinner even though I cooked the meal? Maybe the others in my home are too full from my delicious cooking. Just maybe somewhere along the line I can help someone else who is struggling along their own road and in doing so maybe my road will be a little easier to walk along.  I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that maybe if we took a little more time to listen to what is going on around us, we wouldn't find the world so loud.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,36979,public,self,I shared this with my online group last night.

I have been sober for 759 days now. I stopped drinking cold turkey because the last two times that I drank, my hands would shake, I felt physically sick for a few days after I would drink, and my anxiety for the next week or two would be through the roof. I felt like something bad was going to happen, in a funk, panicky, it just got to a point where I asked "" Why do I keep doing this. Fuck this."" So I stopped drinking. Initially I thought I would just take a few weeks off from drinking, but then weeks turned into months, and then the pandemic hit and it made it easier for me to stay home, not go out with friends and drink. 

BACK STORY: Before I quit drinking, my early to mid 20's I  was in college, drank a lot, partied a lot, and looking back, I also blacked out a lot. A very social drinker. I never drank on my own, or had cravings for drinks, I only drank at parties or social gatherings. However, when I would drink, I found that I would often overdo it. When I was young and in college, I did not notice how drunk I would get because everyone else seemed to be just as drunk as I was. Once I was out of college, my drinking slowed down dramatically, because I was going out to parties less, working full time, etc. But when I would hang out with friends, I would drink in excess. Luckily, at this point in my life, I was a ""happy drunk"". I would dance, have fun, laugh, be very outgoing, but just really drunk. 

This all changed after my father passed away from cancer in 2016. Immediately after he passed away, I started dealing with some really bad depression. I still wouldn't drink on my own, or crave drinks, but again, when I did make myself get out the house to meet up with family or friends for dinner or drinks, I would overdo it, but this time id be emotional/crying and blacking out, just an emotional mess. One of those nights included me blacking out at a bar, waking up with my head cracked open, vomiting all over myself in the hospital, and needing stitches to close the gash over my eye. Till this day, I don't remember what happened. And to be honest from 2016 to 2018ish maybe even into 2019, there are nights that I do not remember at all, where there are pictures of me out with people having fun, but I have no recollection of those events. I think it is a combination of the severe depression along with the alcohol, where I just can't seem to remember months at a time. Honestly it is all a blur.

So fast forward to 2019, in early July I went out to brunch for a friends birthday. This was the first time where I noticed after two drinks my hands began to shake, I felt really paranoid, and in retrospect I think I was having a panic attack. I did not know it at the time but looking back, I think thats what it was. After this day, I took about two weeks off from drinking, until my cousins 21st birthday that we were going to celebrate in Las Vegas. First night out, I felt fine and happy, but after two drinks, I immediately black out and cannot remember the rest of the night. The next morning my hands were still shaking, my anxiety was crippling and I could not leave the hotel room the entire day. I went out at night with everyone since it was the last night, but I didn't really drink and tried to play it off as best as I could. July 27th, 2019 was the last time I drank. 

So July 2019, I stop drinking cold turkey, and figure ill take some time off from drinking. I still smoked weed at this point, I found it helped with my anxiety, helped me sleep at night, and it felt good to smoke and listen to music (which is one of my passions in life), watch movies, etc. However, once the pandemic hit and everything was closing down, my only outings twice a month were for groceries, and weed. One of the days, the line at the shop was long, and I started thinking, if I get COVID from being at this weed shop and I die, or someone in my family dies, that will be the stupidest shit ever. I still bought weed that day, but stopped smoking  soon after (385 days with no weed). 

So I have been sober from alcohol 759 days and weed 385 days. 

I have gotten used to not drinking in smaller social gatherings since, however, I have two bachelor parties coming up and two weddings coming up. I feel like I am in a way better place with my anxiety and depression. I have been considering drinking, because I feel like I am in a better place. BUT I HAVE SOME DOUBTS &amp; QUESTIONS. 

**I apologize in advance if these questions trigger anyone, I do not know where else to go and would appreciate any advice or help.** 

My questions:

How do you know if you're a person that should never touch a drop of alcohol ever again? 

How do I know if I am in  ""a better place"" only ***BECAUSE*** I'm sober or if it is my mental health that has improved and I can drink again? 

How can I know how I will react with alcohol if I don't see how I am with it in my improved current mental state?

So my boyfriend introduced me to his best friend/work buddy and his fiancée (Mary). All four of us are addicts, sober dates ranging from two years and up.


His best friend and Mary have two kids, ~6mo and ~2.5yrs. They were able to go to meetings with the oldest, but the youngest is a bit more fussy. As a stay at home mom, she's not able to leave the house much and not able to bring the kids to meetings when the boys go together. We all went on a week vacation together and Mary expressed to me she really misses meetings and is hard on her not to be able to go anymore.


I would really like to offer to come over while the boys are at meetings, and maybe do a small meeting with just us. 


Meetings were never really my ""thing"" but I gave a good shot and believe that even if it isn't the best option for me that they can be semi-helpful. The only reason I bring this up is because I have no idea how to ""run"" a meeting, and do not want to share this suggestion with Mary just to leave her with all the logistics. 


I understand the basic set ups of a meeting, and could probably fumble my way through making a schedule where we read passages of the big book and talk about them every week, but I would love to have it be more ""interesting"" than just reading literature. Or if it's just reading, is there a better way to set up when/ what parts of the book to read?




Any suggestions on additional things we could do/read or suggestions on how to break up the big book would be great! I am going to be posting this is narcotics anonymous sub and probably be looking to include their literature as well.

Last night i went all out because i was off today and the amount and varieties that i drank is absurd. I felt horrible this morning and on top of that, i decided to cook food at 2 am and left the food in the oven and fell asleep. I guess one of my roomates caught it or i drunkenly turned off the oven.

I poured it into a water bottle and went for a walk, finished the whole thing, ended up walking home in the dark. I hid it from my housemate. I drove to my partners house. I had four big swigs of tequila before I went in (because i didn’t want to be the only one drinking and knew they wouldn’t be), ate a breath mint and didn’t mention I’d been drinking or drove there drunk.

It may be possible to find explanations of spiritual experiences such as ours, but I have often tried to explain my own and have succeeded only in giving the story of it.  I know the feeling it gave me and the results it has brought, but I realize I may never fully understand its deeper why and how.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 313

I had a profound spiritual experience during an open A.A. meeting, which led me to blurt out, 'I'm an alcoholic!'  I have not had a drink since that day.  I can tell you the words I heard just prior to my admission, and how those words affected me, but as to why it happened, I do not know.  I believe a power greater than myself chose me to recover, yet I do not know why.  I try not to worry or wonder about what I do not yet know; instead, I trust that if I continue to work the Steps, practice the A.A. principles in my life, and share my story, I will be guided lovingly toward a deep and mature spirituality in which more will be revealed to me.  For the time being, it is a gift for me to trust God, work the Steps and help others.

I don’t remember much since I basically drank all day Thursday 8Am to 9pm. As well as using cocaine, which idk why I had been sober for over 6 months from that. Well I ended up calling and cursing at my dad while he was at work. In short, I cursed him out and insulted him I took a few low blows with my insults apparently. I also yelled at my mom and insulted her.

My dad, well me and him have a rollover coaster of a relationship. Some days I hate the damn guy other times I feel some sort of pity I don’t fucking know. I feel sad that he has to deal with me and he works so hard. Then I think of how he treats me, how he called the police on me and I think “that guy isn’t your friend, look what he did”. I think of how he forced me through college, when I told him early on about how I was robbing and drinking because I already had a drinking problem at 17. Then at times I think I feel sorry for him, after all he gives me work. I just hate how he speaks about it like he owns me.

With my mom sometimes I just get so frustrated at how she talks. She lives in a make believe land. She thinks one day we can all move into a big house and live happily ever after. When I already told her I don’t even want to eat dinner with them let alone even hear them. To make things worse she now records me whenever I’m drunk to try and shame me. I HATE being recorded, I HATE cameras in general. I literally don’t give a shit about what I did or say especially when I drunk. I don’t want to remember that crap. My ego or just thoughts are just so negative, I just even find ways to shit on her cooking. Like it’s to greasy, or hey you are using vegetable oil from the fucking food drive. I feel bad, but then I hate when she tries to tag team me with my dad. She tries to make me feel bad. 

Today in our AA meeting we discussed the 8th step. I have hurt my family a lot with my drinking. So I tried to apologize. Me and my dad haven’t spoke since Thursday. He started to cry and said I hurt him emotionally after I tried to apologize. Well I didn’t feel a tad bit bad, honestly. I just said “this fucking guy”. In short, it turned into a hour long conversation and he said he didn’t have no hard feelings towards me but that he was done with me. Part of me is relived because I am done with him as well, thankfully I have a good job lined up. I don’t need him. I ask myself, as I recover:

“Does he really care? He didn’t even say happy birthday last Sunday. Is he acting to try to make me feel bad? Is he REALLY done with me? Is he good or bad friend for that?”

I also think: “fuck these guys [mom &amp; dad] I can’t wait until January so I can move out, block them and never speak to them again.”

The 8th step talks about, from my understanding identifying who you hurt and being willing to repair those damages. I did my family the worst, but I am not ready practice forgiveness, real forgiveness to them and myself. I still have some built up negative emotion towards them and I need to analyze where it came from and how to get rid of it. I don’t speak at my meetings but that is what I had built up inside of me as I heard others speak. 

I never want to hurt them, but like I said I need to analyze my emotions and hope that I’m due time our relationship betters.

However, clearly most people who drink as much as I did don't get the same health effects, so there might be some underlying reason it happened to me. Or perhaps i'll learn that it's more common than I know. Here are my symptoms that won't go away:

GERD.

I have severe acid reflux. I take prilosec daily. If I eat certain foods, or too much food, I will get a lot of acid reflux and want to throw it up. I can't really survive without a PPI because it would be very uncomfortable. 

I sometimes have these very weird burps that happen after I eat, that sound very different, like I'm letting out a lot of air.

In addition to this, I have some sort of IBS/IBD?

Basically, from my knowledge most people that have acid reflux, it doesnt effect their ability to eat food. But for me. I get full really quickly now, or definitely quicker than I used to. So i get bloated, and have early satiety. Of course, certain foods (i suspect fried/fatty foods, breads, etc) cause it more than others, but yeah.

I also have some sort of Anal Fissure, or something that gives me sharp pain, but only sometimes, when I poop. It hurts when im consipated, or sometimes even when its these small thin poops it hurts the most which I don't get. But I guess fiber is key. This very well could be unrelated to the drinking, but I felt I'd list it because it might have to do with the gut problems.

I suspect my stomach lining got fcked from the alcohol, and thats part of the reason for this. But any input or advice would be cool I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

It is coming together as a big picture. 

It all start a year ago when my father threatened to murder me on a military base in Ontario, near the capital region of Canada where I was living at the time. Or maybe the story starts with the war in Afghanistan, or 9/11 because I swear my life has been fucked up ever since that day. 

 My father told me he would slit my throat and that he had killed 17 people and would kill me too, would not hesitate, and is very good at it. I hid in my room for two days then forced him to drive me back to the city where I lived and never saw him again. A few weeks later I went to my home city because my sister was getting married and started reaching out to family members for support and action. Every single person silenced me. My grandfather instructed me to stay silent to protect my father, my sister told me if I had a problem I could leave forever. My uncle told me it is normal for a man to act that way, my aunt did nothing, and manipulated me into getting over it. A cousin would stay dead silent everytime I spoke about it. Anytime I spoke about it people would talk about putting me in a psychiatric facility.

 7 ish months ago I finally called the Military Police. They intimidated me, told me I could not give a statement, and sent me to a police department they knew would not help. I tried my local police, they said they were sending officers to interview me, they never showed up, never called, were supposed to call. I gave up for a long time. A week or so ago I decided to start speaking out against the family members who silenced me and told them if they did admit to the coverup and help me find support and take action I would go to the police. They started calling the police on me every time I spoke about the abuse, the coverup, and telling them I was a danger to myself and crazy and attempted to intimidate me, silence me, delegitimize me, and confine me to a psych ward. But the police started believing me immediately and the next day I filed a full police report. They called the police on me again, told my story for the 6th or 7th time and convinced them I wasn't crazy. Later that night the police call, tell me It's all over, there will be no investigation.

So I call another department. They refuse to help. So I call the FIRST department, military police where I had started and they take me seriously STRAIGHT AWAY. I have an active case number. My family told me I'm crazy, that they never were going to stand up for me and I belong in a mental hospital and then all blocked me. Everyone. Aunt uncle sister cousins grandparents ALLL GONE. But I have an active police investigation and an independent journalist who is interested in my story.

 I have contacted all three major Canadian news stations but have not yet heard back. My father is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and he has PTSD and is unstable and is dangerous to himself and the public. I have seen him threaten people in public so many times. they did NOT protect the public.

 I told my family I will not stop speaking out against the way they coverup child abuse. We have a family history related to this: My mother's father murder her mother and committed suicide in front of his children and they REFUSE to take this seriously. Infact my uncle, her brother told me it is totally normal for a man to do that to his family. 

So I am returning to the capital in one week and beginning to fight a lengthy legal and media campaign against my father, My entire extended family network on both sides, my police, federal government, and military. I will attempt to organize with other discarded veterans and military families in the capital. I lost my job due to stress. I am now penniless. Nothing left in the world, but someone has offered me a place to stay and i had travel points saved on my card.

At one point I became so hopeless I am almost drank myself to death and wound up in a detox centre. Which ended up being a great thing because as of last week I am 4 months sober.

My temporary sponsor and I had a falling out about a month ago and since then, I have been going downhill. They suffer from big mental health issues which I was not quite aware of. This resulted in them lashing out at me one day and being really verbally abusive to me. I stood up for myself and we parted ways.

When we developed still more, we discovered the best possible source of emotional stability to be God Himself.  We found that dependence upon His perfect justice, forgiveness, and love was healthy, and that it would work where nothing else would.  If we really depended upon God, we couldn't very well play God to our fellows nor would we feel the urge wholly to rely on human protection and care.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 116

All my life I depended on people for my emotional needs and security, but today I cannot live that way anymore.  By the grace of God, I have admitted my powerlessness over people, places and things.  I had been a real 'people addict'; wherever I went there had to be someone who would pay some kind of attention to me.  It was the kind of attitude that could only get worse, because the more I depended on others and demanded attention, the less I received.  I have given up believing that any human power can relieve me of that empty feeling.  Although I remain a fragile human being who needs to work A.A.'s Steps to keep this particular principle before my personality, it is only a loving God who can give me inner peace and emotional stability.

It was time to embark on my journey of sobriety if I wanted to live. I did. It lasted the better part of 20 years. Until it didn’t. 

My relapse began in my early 40’s and lasted almost 4 years. 😞 I have now been gratefully sober for a little over 2 years. I’m 48 years old. 

That 4ish? year relapse almost killed me, and definitely killed every important relationship I had. This is what happens when an alcoholic is active in their addiction. Nothing and no one is sacred or protected from the consequences of their choices.

I fight daily to have half of the strength my disease does. (Yes, it’s a disease) The almost 20 years of sobriety I had were no match for my alcoholic make up, even with all of that time and knowledge of my issues under my belt. I talked myself into the insanity and made the choice to drink. 😞 My disease was far worse than it was in my 20s almost immediately. 😞

I’m STILL trying to rebuild all that I lost. I share my struggles and victories publicly today because I fell flat on my face publicly - I want the world to see that I’m trying, I’m working, I’m doing everything I can to just do the next right thing - and this shit is HARD!!!! 
Trying to repair broken trust and build new foundations in to old relationships that have been tarnished, is fucking hard! But, I wake up each day determined to keep doing the next right thing, and no matter what, I don’t take a drink. When life gets too lifey, I now have healthy tools and resources to utilize, that get me through the moment.

I am Michelle. I’m a wife, a daughter, a sister and a mother and I’m an alcoholic in recovery, recovering publicly and loudly for all to hear and see in hopes of saving one person from having to go through some of this shit, or of helping someone who’s currently in it. You can do this!

I knew early on that the key to understanding alcoholism was in Jim's story in the big book. I suggest you read this story so you can relate to my post. Jim had this foolish idea that he could drink whiskey if only he put it in milk. Now the key word here is **foolish** as Jim is not a stupid or ignorant man. This is called **foolishness** and how did he get to this point? Deception, **self- deception** to be exact. Now if you have read the story what comes next? Destruction, **self -destruction.** One more journey for Jim to the asylum, the same one he just got out of and a good chance to loose his family. Only to wake up remembering the insane idea won out, asking ourselves **how it could have happened again.**  My take on this insanity **(extreme foolishness)** is the drink is always after the self deception. It is a closed loop system that feeds back onto itself with self deception and self destruction asking myself how could this have happened to me again only to repeat that same process again in the not so far distant future. It is a learnt process that for me was very hard to get out of. In my opinion this parasitic processing of thinking is the addiction and the result is alcoholism.

I've been hanging in the background of this subreddit for the last few weeks. For the last 2/3 years my drinking has been getting completely out of control. I always told myself it was just a phase, it would sort it's self out. Of course this didn't happen and was just classic excuses.

Two weeks ago, i had a very bad night because, as usual, the party never stops for me. I kept drinking and drinking. Saying nasty and vicious stuff to my girlfriend, close friends etc. I swore off drinking, still believing I wasn't an alcoholic. After two weeks of no drinking, this all took a turn for the worst last night.

I met up with an old friend to go jam at a studio. I went to a pub for a few while i waited for her to arrive. When she arrived, i went into a local shop and bought 5 cans to take with me. The session went pretty well. She dropped me off in town after and i went to another pub. It was actually a good time, met some awesome people. When the pubs shut and it was time to go home, my mood turned sour. I knew i had to go home and face my girlfriend and my best friend who would know I'd been drinking. I got mad at myself, anxious and eventually arrogant, telling myself i was completely fine to drink like this. When i got home, i kicked off, grabbed a bottle of something that had been in the cupboard and drank it in 3 gulps.

My neighbour was in and she was trying to calm me and help me. In my drink fuelled rage, i wanted to go out and find a fight for some reason, so i started grabbing weapons, a long jacket, boots etc. It gets hazy after this but i didn't leave the house. Next thing i remember was being alone in my living room, paranoid my neighbours partner was wanting to hurt me.

This morning I've woke up and as much as my GF and BF are upset and hurt, they completely understand and have been really supportive. My neighbour hasn't spoke to me but i have sent a message apologising. I grabbed my phone came straight to this subreddit and i'm finally able to admit that i am an alcoholic, I'm not in control and i need to overhaul my life, the people in it, the places i go and most importantly, not to have that first drink again.

I'm not sure exactly why I've wrote this but it feels good to admit it. Like a weight has been lifted but i know there is still a lot of work left to do. I know the hardest part is in a while i can't let myself get too comfortable and convince myself that i can drink again and it'll be fine. I know won't be.

Thank you if you've read this far.

I've just past 14 months no alcohol and 18 months no cocaine. I joined a zoom meeting AA group in February, and I have not participated but I have gotten so much from the speakers sharing their stories each session. I've probably been to 150 meetings since then. 

I haven't done the program properly in regards to doing the steps or getting a sponsor, I have resistance to jump in fully as I feel like a fraud because I'm not completely clean. 

I have long term serious diagnosed depression, and have been medicated for it. I also take an weed edible a few times a month as it doesn't trigger self destructive behaviour for me.. I generally order some take out and watch a movie. 

I guess what I'm asking for is feedback on whether I can participate if I'm committed to not drinking alcohol or using cocaine,  those substances were my downfall and I've recognized that. I keep coming back to the line ""the only requirement is the desire to stop drinking "" , but I don't want to piss off a group if they become aware that I sometimes use cannabis.

My stability came out of trying to give, not out of demanding that I receive.

- THE BEST OF BILL, pp. 46-47

As long as I try, with all my heart and soul, to pass along to others what has been passed along to me, and do not demand anything in return, life is good to me.  Before entering this program of Alcoholics Anonymous I was never able to give without demanding something in return.  Little did I know that, once I began to give freely of myself, I would begin to receive, without ever expecting or demanding anything at all.  What I receive today is the gift of 'stability,' as Bill did: stability in my A.A. program; within myself; but most of all, in my relationship with my Higher Power, whom I choose to call God.

I hit several rock bottoms during the past week. Boyfriend almost left me last week after blowing my final chance (ultimatum if you will) but decided to give me ONE last chance. 

We did separate for a few days so he could have space. I stayed with my parents who were surprisingly supportive and hid all the alcohol from me. When I told them my boyfriend and I might split, they immediately asked, ""Because of your drinking?"" So it's been a well-known problem everyone was aware of except ME. I've been in denial about the pain I've been causing. I also have a soon-to-be 3-year-old daughter to think about and set a good example for. 

Then on Sunday I ended up in the hospital with a severely inflamed gallbladder and gallstones. One stone was blocking the duct so I required emergency surgery. I was hospitalized for almost 2 days and due to the new covid surge, I wasn't able to get a room nor have any visitors. So I was stuck in the E.R. with no TV or company, which was like an unofficial in-patient rehab. Me being alone with my thoughts really helped me self-reflect. 

Thankfully the surgery went well and I'm currently recovering. I was granted 2 weeks off work. The doctors gave me fluids to detox, and I had a doctor sit and chat with me about my alcohol use and told me flat-out if I keep going the way I am, I will surely have liver failure and / or liver cancer by age 40 (I'm 27). That was an eye-opener for me. I have a loving partner and amazing daughter that I want to live for, be healthy for, set a good example...drinking is just not worth it. I find myself not even craving it, which is a good start. I've tried to quit before but was always on edge waiting for the next opportunity to drink. 

My boyfriend has been supportive and keeps telling me he's proud of how strong I'm being, but I can see the doubt and fear in his eyes. I know it'll take awhile to regain his trust and respect. But it'll be all so worth it. I feel this all happened for a reason. Me deciding to quit and then being hospitalized immediately after just sealed the deal. It's not just about our relationship anymore, but my health is also on the line. We only get one life and we all get the promise of death. Whether I die tomorrow or in 60 years, I want it to be due to something that was OUT of my control. In the meantime, I want to enjoy the ride and not waste it.

Even with the last 90 days being tumultuous I don’t want to drink . I have cirrhosis and sobriety is my only path to life and I intend to honor that commitment but is this normal leading up to the work of step 4? Is the cosmic ickiness pushing me back out of my comfort zones to do hard work ? I don’t have a sponsor as I still cannot figure out how and I really really feel like they needed to discuss that more in treatment.

In ways, I was partly still the same girl but I made bad decisions that affected others around me and myself. I lacked attention from my ex boyfriend (this type of attention I have always been greedy with because I was neglected by my father) and alcohol made me turn to others for this attention. I had so much anxiety when I felt neglected, and I used that as an excuse to drink. I used everything as an excuse to drink. Hanging out with friends, having a hard day, being sad, being bored, celebrating an event, Any excuse you can think of I had it, and used it. It’s hard to explain how i became able to control my drinking. I already naturally have so much energy and positivity, I didn’t need alcohol to give me a boost. I still drink but I don’t need it to get through anything or everything. I have more self confidence, I’m not as needy, or sad.

Since defective relations with other human beings have nearly always been the immediate cause of our woes, including our alcoholism, no field of investigation could yield more satisfying and valuable rewards than this one.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 80

Willingness is a peculiar thing for me in that, over a period of time, it seems to come, first with awareness, but then with a feeling of discomfort, making me want to take some action.  As I reflected on taking the Eighth Step, my willingness to make amends to others came as a desire for forgiveness, of others and myself.  I felt forgiveness toward others after I became aware of my part in the difficulties of relationships.  I wanted to feel the peace and serenity described in the Promises.  From working the first seven Steps, I became aware of whom I had harmed and that I had been my own worst enemy.  In order to restore my relationships with my fellow human beings, I knew I would have to change.  I wanted to learn to live in harmony with myself and others so that I could also live in emotional freedom.  The beginning of the end to my isolation - from my fellows and from God - came when I wrote my Eighth Step list.

My name is Steve and I'm an alcoholic. I will start this off by saying I am 684 days alcohol free now. I never thought I could not drink this long.  But in my ""hay day"" of drinking, I would drive drunk frequently. Ok frequently isn't correct. I drive drunk damn near every night. I would hit the bars closer them out then drive home. My thought process every time was that I didn't want to leave my truck at the bar, my parents, who I lived with at the time would get pissed. Anyway, I did this well over 200 times. I don't have an exact number of course. But I am lucky because I ended up getting a DUI without causing an accident.  It was a wake up call for me to stop drinking and driving. About 10 years after my DUI, I began to drink and drive again, I had fallen into a pretty deep depression (still working on tbh) I tried to kill myself 3 times, all while being completely hammered.  I spent 28 days in an inpatient rehab/mental health facility.  It was the best decision of my entire life. 

I have spent the last two years working my butt off to get better. And here is the thing: it does get better. I started off going to AA multiple times a week. It was such a big help for me.  I feel more confident, I have no hang overs, I have better conversations, and I just feel better. It's not easy but you can do it. I believe that everyone is a beautiful human being and is worth being around on this planet. The journey is exciting. It's the best part of life. It's what life is all about. The journey. 

I have learned how to truly live life to the fullest.  Without alcohol in my life I have been able to change careers, nice to a new city, I got a dog, and I bought my first home. Those are things I don't think I would've been able to accomplish while drinking. I am grateful for getting to where I am today.

Thats how the alcoholic mind works, that I’m rationalizing with myself. He also mentioned how rationalization is the first part in a relapse. Which makes complete sense to me. I’m currently on my 4th step and I need to keep working it, and hit more meetings no doubt.

One of the sponsees ""left the chat"" weeks later, and my sponsor texted me (individually) saying how hurt she was by this and some other things. It really took me aback and I felt uncomfortable. At the time, I was very insecure and didn't know how to respond with good boundaries. I think now if that happened, I may react differently. 

Anyways, the group chat continues and I really don't care for the random photos and statements. They're not always connected to sobriety or recovery. The group text was originally just to share a zoom ID and password. I am trying to be willing to take direction and suggestion from her. But I find myself becoming angry or resentful.

This man has 20+ years of sobriety and hasn’t had a sponsor since his last one passed away several years ago.  He shares every day and lectures all of us about what it was like for him 20 years ago and what we should do to stay sober. He is loud, swears, says the same things day after day, and regularly tells us that he doesn’t come to meetings to recover, he comes to help others. He comes late, leaves shortly after sharing, and ignores our meeting protocol of turning off his phone.  Invariably his phone rings or dings during every meeting.  He makes himself the center of attention and then once he has said his bit, he doesn’t extend respect to others by staying until the end.  Several long term members have found other meetings to attend so they can avoid him.

Everyone with a desire to stop drinking is welcome and I know I have the option of changing meetings if I don’t like it.  This guys personality is having such a negative impact on the group that I am hopeful for advice on how to address this appropriately with the group.

When I came into the program, I was not only broke, but I was also seriously in debt, with no hope of ever finding a way out of the deep hole I’d dug. I’d become accustomed to spending every penny I earned or stole on drugs and alcohol, then using whatever was left over for food and shelter. I used whatever credit cards a bank was foolish enough to give me to further fund my dysfunctional lifestyle. I begged, borrowed or stole whatever was necessary to maintain enough of a buzz that I didn’t have to feel the pain in my life. My finances were but one of the heavy rocks holding me in slavery to my addictions – when added to my selfishness, shame, guilt, arrogance, anger, denial, lying, stealing, hiding, resentment, and bitterness, I was convinced I was doomed to die miserably, and most of my days were spent simply waiting for that to happen. There was no way I could ever get sober, let alone dig my way out of the numerous deep holes I’d dug.

But AA promised a solution, and a way out of my hopelessness and despair. One step at a time, the weight of despair began to lift and darkness slowly turned to light; one day at a time, as I made small bits of progress, hopelessness slowly turned into hopefulness. I was learning how to move from emotional and spiritual bankruptcy to the first hints of recovery solvency. And, as I continued, I began banking small amounts of recovery experience which grew over time into capital I could use to invest in others. By making daily investments in my recovery, my reserves grew and I had more freedom to move about my life without fear, growing daily in confidence but without the arrogance I carried when I was using.

AA gave me, for the first time in my life, a sense of faith that all my messes could be cleaned up - my ruined relationships could be restored, my abysmal finances could be recovered, and my bitterness and hatred could be healed. Yes, it took time, and yes, it was hard, but the program worked and I got my life back. Today, my finances are healthy and expertly managed – I’m free from debt and have significant reserves from which to draw when I have an opportunity to serve. I’m not talking about money (although that’s also in excellent working order), I’m talking about my spiritual, emotional, relational and physical finances and, despite having many days of sobriety, it’s this blessing of recovery that I cherish and into which I continue to make deposits. Like my bank accounts, when I stop making deposits, the accounts stop growing and it doesn’t take long for them to become overdrawn. Every day is another opportunity to invest in my recovery and keep my accounts filled.

However, I figured this would be the place to go for some insight. I’m 30 days sober and struggling. I’m a 21 year old male, and I’ve been a heavy daily drinker since I was 18 years old. This is the longest I’ve remained absent from alcohol in the last 4 years. My daily intake ranged from 2-10 drinks (usually at night) up until I turned 21.

 I’m in a particularly toxic &amp; codependent relationship which has caused me a great deal of stress, injuries, and run-ins with the local police. It’s been going on for about a year and a half on and off. We live together and don’t have the financial means to separate. About 8 months ago I had discovered infidelities in my relationship. Alongside coming to terms that my partner is a pathological liar who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. But if you asked me, I’d tell you she was misdiagnosed and is a clinical sociopath. 

I tried to use alcohol to make my situation more tolerable, perhaps to induce a mental blindness to the reality in which I was living. It got out of control pretty quickly. My mental health tanked, in result I quit my job. Anxiety was the main issue, making work seem unbearable. At my worst I was consuming about 3/4 of a 1.75 of 40% abv liquor daily. This continued for several months before withdrawal seemed to be constant no matter how much I drank. My anxiety was also out of control, I spent most of my time panicking and crying. Getting to sleep was the worst part of everyday. The anxiety was always worse at night. 

We had gotten suddenly evicted from our apartment, and were homeless for about a week before finding a new place. We were living in an Airbnb. The situation was a great deal of stress on top of having to manage my addiction. I was confident we were screwed. I suppose we got lucky. Once we moved into the new place I made the decision to go through my withdrawal in hope to find clarity &amp; mental stability in sobriety. I did taper, and it did it very carefully. I would consume exactly a shot of my liquor of choice every 4 hours. I did this for about 2 days before going cold turkey. The withdrawal wasn’t too extreme. Shakes, stomach pains, nausea, mild visual impairment (tracers), and of course insomnia were the main symptoms. This lasted about 3 days.

After getting through the rough part, the “pink cloud” phase began. I felt great, I was so proud of what I had accomplished. I was finally living again, functioning beyond what I had imagined. It lasted roughly a week. Then the hard part hit me. Having to deal with all of the things I had been avoiding in my head, mostly regarding my relationship and living situation. I’m finding it harder and harder to communicate and express love to my partner, as I hold a lot of resentment against her. Depression and a feeling of emptiness has consumed me. Although, I do have to state that my anxiety has significantly decreased post cessation.

I apologize for the lengthy post.

I was making a fear inventory, thinking of everything that I’m afraid of. It’s a ton and understand I have some stuff to work on with myself. Specifically, letting go and letting god (as I understand him). 

One thing I came across was plastic hangers. I, as well as siblings, were “spanked” up to or over 20 swats each per session. Varied based on moms anger that day. Going up the lower back all the way to the ankles. I involuntarily recoil when I see them. 

Clearly, I’m holding onto resentment to work through. But beyond physical abuse, it turned mental/emotional after running away to a friends house “making a scene”. I realized today, I don’t love my mom. I’m remorseful to my ex-wife, my current gf, my siblings, their spouses, my dad, so I know I’m future forecasting for step 9. I don’t know if it is wise to apologize to an abuser. 

I called my mom to try to work through this. All I wanted was for her to own up to abuse. Not spanking as condoned by her Bible. But the abuse and terror she put me through as an authority figure brings back bad memories. My intent wasn’t to force a confession, but to just bring to light the fear and suppressed emotion. It obviously didn’t go as hoped, though I’m not surprised. She has also compulsively lied and told my sibs that I told her to not contact my gf as to insinuate I am manipulative and isolating my gf. I never said this and in fact was the one to give my gf a family members phone number so she could have support. This isn’t the first time she has pathologically been dishonest. 

I’ve been sober 25 days. Don’t have plans to go back to my old ways. Read the big book cover to cover. Meetings everyday. Sponsor. But am looking for some advice from some other victims of abuse. I will clean my side of the street, not looking to change minds of someone who is beyond reason. 

I WANT to let go. I dont want to dwell, but don’t want to suppress either. But as I see it, letting go means keeping a family member at arms length. Rationally, I’m fine with this. Emotionally, I’m saddened by the loss of relationship, but would rather surround myself with positive people who want to grow. I’ve received texts and letters from this person and interactions range from neutral to negative to downright enraging. “Let go, or be dragged”. “Where is the credit for all the things I did right?”. “I used a hanger because they broke before things got out of hand”. “Your siblings had it worse”. “Dad wouldn’t let harm come to you”. “You won’t know until you have kids”. A million ways to say what happened was okay.

I get it. She fed and clothed me. I want to show gratitude where it’s due. But I recognize the Muenshester-like relationship that wasn’t healthy then or now; for either of us. She’s bored without kids to control and has seemed to take pleasure in my (and brothers heart health) shit storm before I got on the right path with AA.

The fucked up part is I recognize the same irritability, discontent, and restlessness in both of us. However, I chose the bottle. Not to hit kids and gaslight them then and now (now adult). I want to make it clear that I CHOSE to drink. It helped me escape emotions, work-related stress, and shortcomings/defects of my character. I recognize how selfish I was (and am). But I’ve been lying and hiding for so long, I just want to live honestly. I feel set free by admitting to myself and others that I’m an alcoholic.

This ridiculous tripe about ""don't make any major decisions for a year"" is bullshit.

Divorcing King Alcohol was a major decision.

EVERY Step is a major decision.

The Big Book makes clear that we need live life on God's terms. How do I live life on God's terms if I'm HIDING from His terms? Getting married (or divorced) are major decisions. Am I suppose to leave my bride at the altar because I decided to get sober today? Or put off divorcing a cheating, abusive spouse because I'm not drunk enough to make the decision? Getting a job is a major decision. Am I supposed to leech off the family, friends, neighbors, and communities I've been abusing for decades, JUST so i don't make a major decision for the next year? Shit, what if I'm female and pregnant? Having a baby is a major decision, keeping it or giving it up for adoption is a major decision, having an abortion is a major decision... I'd be FUCKED, unless I commit suicide to avoid making the decision...and THAT'S a major decision.

DAMN.

The literature implores me to be fearless and thorough from the very start. It tells me God can and will if he's sought. It doesn't say ""don't get a God for a year because that's a major decision!""

And then this shit about ""just don't drink and go to meetings cos meeting makers ✌️ make it ✌️.""

“We are unable, at certain times, to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago. We are without defense against the first drink.” BB,Page 24 

If I could ""just not drink,"" what the hell do I need A.A. for?

Go to meetings? Where does the big book suggest ""running to meetings and regurgitating my feelings because we're all qualified to offer group therapy in here?"" 90 in 90? are you FUCKING kidding me? Unless you're making that 90 in 90 strictly speaker meetings, what's the point? You don't have anything to offer in terms of recovery, and, as pg 164 states, you can't transmit what you don't have, therefore, what good is it doing ANYBODY for a room full of non-program-working newcomers to sit around and share their misinformation and confusion with one another? And no, the Fellowship is NOT the program. ""Here are the STEPS we took which are suggested as a program of recovery."" 

""meeting makers make it?"" make what, gingerbread cookies? I've seen people go to a meeting, go to the bar next  door immediately after, get in a car, and die drunk the very same night. WORK...THE...STEPS.

Rehab is KILLING us. Statistically, A.A.s were recovering successfully at a rate of almost 80% prior to the advent of modern rehabs. Since? Less than 5% of new members from 1995 onward have five years.

I'm on day 22 of my sobriety. I'm feeling good for the most part - I've been hitting up 2 meetings a day when I can.  Getting some great support and meeting some great people. Have not got a sponsor yet but I am planning to do that when I find someone I connect with.

One thing Im noticing is that I seem to be building up a lot of anger and resentment towards people in my life.  I'm not sure what to make of this and I'm sure it's nothing new it's just that in my drinking days I'd get hammered and bury those emotions and now they remain and it seems to be building up. For example at work one of my colleagues is selling more than me in the last few weeks and each time I watch his totals get higher than mine it makes me angry. I guess that's my ego. We don't even get paid commission so this literally has no impact on my job but because I'm not the best I want to get back at him. It sounds crazy. Another example is my wife's sister asked her to attend an event on the weekend so I have to change my plans this weekend instead of going to the cabin I have to stay home to look after my kid and I found myself scheming to get back at her sister for ruining my weekend. 

These are really petty things in the grand scheme of things but in my current state it just seems to be building up. I tried reciting the lord's prayer and serenity prayer but it doesn't seem to be helping. I have not really mastered step 2 and 3 - I am 100% accepting that I am an alcoholic and my life is unmanageable. I am having a problem accepting that God will help me because I've always only had myself never been a man of faith!!

Very deep, sometimes quite forgotten, damaging emotional conflicts persist below the level of consciousness.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pp. 79-80

Only through positive action can I remove the remains of guilt and shame brought on by alcohol.  Throughout my misadventures when I drank, my friends would say, 'Why are you doing this?  You're only hurting yourself.'  Little did I know how true were those words.  Although I harmed others, some of my behavior caused grave wounds to my soul.  Step Eight provides me with a way of forgiving myself.  I alleviate much of the hidden damage when I make my list of those I have hurt.  In making amends, I free myself of burdens, thus contributing to my healing.

So background story: I’ve drifted away from aa for the last 5 months. Kinda went down a rabbit hole of wondering if I needed complete abstinence or not. I figured alcohol wasn’t that important anyways, so there was no need to test it out. 
I told myself im not out of aa. I can go back whenever I want, and that I really did want to someday mainly so I could sponsor other women since others tell me that’s where the magic is. 
Anyways
I drank this beer with the guy I’m dating at his apartment. It was the last beer in his fridge, so I couldn’t have drank even if I wanted to continue. Im not upset with myself for drinking. I don’t believe my life is in shams now because I had one beer.

I do know that the separation I’ve had from alcohol has been very eye-opening for me, which is why I’m turned off by the idea of drinking at all. I’m afraid it’ll affect my relationship with god by me not continuing my spiritual practices. It’s hard to show up for yourself and others when alcohol is involved. 

Anyways. So I’m not depressed. I’m actually feeling pretty great mentally and spiritually. I have moments where I’m not fond of aa, like the last few months. But ultimately, I’m grateful for the program. So how would I get involved again? I don’t want others to look down on me cause I had one beer lol. I just know that it doesn’t align with what I want. 

Idk.

I just got home from a doctors appointment. I have a lot of chronic health problems, one of them being fatty liver. My ultrasound showed mild a year ago when I had it. Blood work was elevated about a year ago but has been consistently normal. I get liver pain, especially after drinking. I’ve never had a fibroscan even though I pushed and pushed. I also know you can have damage even with normal ALT AST.

So here I was at my appointment, listening to myself talk as my anxiety has spiraled out of control. I also have severe health anxiety. I was honest that I don’t drink nightly but when I do, it’s 3-5 drinks. Sometimes it is nightly a few days in a row. When I asked for reassurance regarding my liver, she said “You need to abstain or your liver won’t be okay.” This was my wake up call. I don’t know why but it felt so powerful to hear it from my doctor. 

So here I go, on my journey to sobriety. I’ve had so many day 1’s and that can’t happen anymore. I don’t know if I feel ready but I have to be. This is for me. While it feels like this is a negative, like a HUGE loss that I’m grieving… I’m realizing I need to look at this as a positive, as a win, as freedom. 

As I head into my journey I do not want to do AA but I am wondering if there is a support person that can help me. Like a sponsor but just a support person that I could call or text on hard days. Someone that’s sober. I don’t want to be a burden but know I’ll need support and encouragement, especially on weekends. Anyone out there?

This may be a long post, thank you for reading and helping.

Last Saturday was an all time low for me. I was hospitalized for attempted suicide while visiting my girlfriend. 

I started drink in 8th grade. At the time it would be some Smirnoff ices every 2 months. While I began taking shot in Highschool, the frequency of drinking never really increased. I tried to limit my alcohol consumption because alcoholism runs in my family, three family members currently fall victim to it. 

I went to college and began drinking more often. My freshman year wasn’t bad, although there would be spurts of blacking out and getting wasted. After joining a fraternity my second semester I noticed I drank significantly more, but so did everyone else hung out with. 

My sophomore year I met my girlfriend. She is above my league and I would be nervous around her, this would result in me drinking before I hung out with her - luckily we would go to parties together so it wouldn’t be suspicious or weird. As we started dating, I became comfortable around her. 

My junior year was pretty much my first incident. It was HER 21st birthday and I blacked out at her pregame, even though I couldn’t go to the bars. Normally blacking out wasn’t that much of an issue, but I was a mess there. Her friends were no happy and she was concerned. A few months later I turned 21 and had a pregame. I tried to not black out in fear of repairing the same events, but my fraternity brother literally shoved alcohol down my mouth. That night we had probably our first big fight. I was saying nonsense, called my ex to prove a point, and puked all over her bathroom. 

Senior year she moved back to DC, she was a year older. To not feel lonely, I decided to live in the fraternity house. Things then began to worsen again. It was fun and games drinking but I had more incidents. Shortly before my birthday I blacked out at th bars and cheated on my gf and got a lap dance from a Stripper. I even got her snapchap to have sex with her that night, luckily I fell asleep after ubering home. More arguments with my gf ensued, she even told me that she began having feeling for another guy.

I decided to go to grad school since COVID took away a lot of jobs. That is when I really noticed that this relationship with alcohol began deteriorating. I would be a dumbass and start fights when drinking with my friends. I also would try to start fights at random people at the bars, on the streets, and even a nurse once who shared an Uber with me. I even cheated on my gf again but getting another lap dance, this time on my birthday but at the same strip club.

I noticed that I would become an aggressive drunk now. This leads us to last week. I went to dc to visit my gf for 10 days. I arrived Friday and we made plans to go out with her family/friends to get bottomless mimosas. At this time I haven’t had alcohol in a while - this is mostly because I started antidepressants and was scared to drink on it. The days before going to DC I increased my prescription. The day we drank was my second day on this increase [300 xl bupropion]. I noticed that I got tipsy quickly, but wanted to pace myself. I began posting non-pc content on social media while drinking - I noticed I did this to spark arguments with people. 

We went home and I was ready to stop… I wanted to stop. When I start drinking I find it very hard to stop. I was also iced my my gf’s brother 4 different times, one of them being a big bottle. 

I was being a disrespectful dumbass infront if my gf, her brother, and young uncle. I began telling her secrets and we had an argument. I stormed off and began walking to her place. I grabbed my suitcase, told her parents that I think it is over between us, and began walking to the airport (2:30 hours away). On the way to the airport I went to the liquor store and bought a fifth of whiskey. 

I began crying and walking. I called my gf that it is over. I layed down on a patch of grass and told some more of my antidepressants. She called again and I told her what I did. I called my family and told them that I love them and said goodbye. My girlfriend told my mom the situation - my mom attempted suicide when I was young. 

My girlfriend found me walking the streets with my suitcase in one hand and a bottle in the other. She grabbed the bottle and threw it on the ground. The cops arrived later and took me to the hospital for attempted suicide.

I went to the worst hospital in DC, verified by the internet. They took my belongings, phone, rosary, and shoes. They put me in a chair and locked me in a room with other mentally unstable people. I was there for 18 hours. They ran out of water. Took 40 minutes to bring me ibuprofen after puking. They wouldn’t let me call my gf - I had to tel them I was calling my sister.

Now I am home. I don’t feel good. I wanted to have a good time drinking with my gf and her family. I am still dating my gf, but she isn’t too hopeful about things right now and I don’t blame her. 

Even now, I still crave a nice six pack of coors. Even after all of this, I would struggle turning down a drink.

In many instances we shall find that though the harm done others has not been great, the emotional harm we have done ourselves has.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p.
79

Have you ever thought that the harm you did a business associate, or perhaps a family member, was so slight that it really didn't deserve an apology because they probably wouldn't remember it anyway?  If that person, and the wrong done to him, keeps coming to mind, time and again, causing an uneasy or perhaps guilty feeling, then I put that person's name at the top of my 'amends list,' and become willing to make a sincere apology, knowing I will feel calm and relaxed about that person once this very important part of my recovery is accomplished.

So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc. Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction. Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities. This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health. I stopped dreaming as frequently since then.

Last night I slipped up out of nowhere. Unprovoked. I have no idea why I did it.

I work as a bartender. I know that sounds crazy but it pays well, has good benefits and I'm newly married and trying to stack money as much as possible. Plus I have no other skills, no college history etc. 

I was charged with making a batch of sangria for a function. I made it. I was waiting for a coworker to come taste test it for me to see if it needed any other ingredients. He was taking a while, so without even thinking I dipped a straw in and put some on my tongue. I spit it out, and added more ingredients. Tried another straw full. This time I swallowed it. 

Before I knew it I was pouring sangria into a cup and chugging it, over and over. Then I snapped out of it, ""what am I doing""  I thought. So I continued cleaning up to end my shift. Went back for another cup of sangria. I had 5 or 6 cups of it. Finally ended my shift. While waiting outside for my ride, I went back to the bar, grabbed a brand new bottle of scotch, ripped off the top and took a big swig right out of the bottle before going home to my wife. 

I brushed my teeth, used mouthwash, ate a bunch of breath mints and had some food. I have yet to tell her. I'm working all day today and am absolutely dreading telling her when I get home.

How am I gonna tell her? What am I gonna say to my mother? I tortured my poor mother for years. She was finally free from worry. Now I'm about to send her right back to worrying 24/7.

Over half a decade sober only to throw it all away for nothing. For seemingly no reason. There was barely any thought to what I did, just impulse. I feel like a complete failure. Sobriety was one of the few things in life I can say I was proud of. Now what?

We might next ask ourselves what we mean when we say that we have 'harmed' other people.  What kinds of 'harm' do people do one another, anyway?  To define the word 'harm' in a practical way, we might call it the result of instincts in collision, which cause physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual damage to people.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 80

I had been to Eighth Step meetings, always thinking, 'I really haven't harmed many people, mostly myself.'  But the time came when I wrote my list out and it was not as short as I thought it would be.  I either liked you, disliked you, or needed something from you - it was that simple.  People hadn't done what I wanted them to do and intimate relationships were out of hand because of my partners' unreasonable demands.  Were these 'sins of omission'?  Because of my drinking, I had 'dropped out' - never sending cards, returning calls, being there for other people, or taking part in their lives.  What a grace it has been to look at these relationships, to make my inventories in quiet, alone with the God of my understanding, and to go forth daily, with a willingness to be honest and forthright in my relationships.

I’m an alcoholic, a liar, a fraud. I’ve sold myself short every point in life and thrown away my goals to hide from the difficult parts of life. I know my drinking, anxiety and depression are holding me back from who I want to be.

I felt for a few months that I had finally been given a normal life, that God had genuinely restored me to sanity. The voices in my head were GONE and the fears, endless worry etc were GONE. I literally could not believe it. I was living every single day in the fourth dimension Bill talks about and it was indescribable. 

After moving a bunch of times and relocating, ive found a lot of groups (most groups it seems) talking mostly about the fellowship, using AA groups to rant about their personal problems, endless slogans etc. 

I worked with sponsors in these groups, and I sponsored guys as best I could. But slowly my life started changing, not to blissful enjoyable sobriety, walking in Union with my creator- but to emotional turmoil - still wanting to drink but shutting my mind to the possibility. Feeling fearful 99% of the time. 

I eventually started veering away from the program, because I felt I was getting nothing out of it. And I thought, if I only have an hour of self time, I would rather just meditate or study the Big Book on my own.

It’s been a few years of this, and I am trying to find a guy to work with - it’s so frustrating knowing the solution and not having the means to implement that solution. 

I have been meeting hopping for weeks, waiting to hear just one person talk about the steps, waiting to hear one person talk about What God has done in their lives. And I have not heard anything!! 

I don’t want to just coast through sobriety anymore. I don’t want to suffer through untreated alcoholism. 

I guess I’m partly ranting, but also very much hoping someone can help me or point me in the right direction.

Some of us, though, tripped over a very different snag.  We clung to the claim that when drinking we never hurt anybody but ourselves.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 79

This Step seemed so simple.  I identified several people whom I had harmed, but they were no longer available.  Still, I was uneasy about the Step and avoided conversations dealing with it.  In time I learned to investigate those Steps and areas of my life which made me uncomfortable.  My search revealed my parents, who had been deeply hurt by my isolation from them; my employer, who worried about my absences, my memory lapses, my temper; and the friends I had shunned, without explanation.  As I faced the reality of the harm I had done, Step Eight took on new meaning.  I am no longer uncomfortable and I feel clean and light.

I'm new to this lifestyle, as well as being open and asking for help. I suppose I'm looking for reassurance, knowing that it's normal (ish) and that things will get better. The long road is easier to drive if you know you're going in the right direction.

I cut off ALL of my friends. Means i am completely alone since 2020. i even cut off a few Girls that i had contact with and when they asked why i want to end it, i just made up some stuff so they dont feel bad.

I think that i am losing my sanity and i have that feeling since march or so.
When i am drunk i can only think about killing, i am laughing because of my thoughts while sitting alone in my flat at night. Yesterday night i constantly repeated to myself „its going to get better“. I repeated this sentence about 1000 times at least till i fell asleep.

One girl still tries to stick with me. She sends me messages on my email and asks me if i am ok and if i would allow her to come over so she can babysit me.

My answers are always the same. I am insulting her because i believe that she is the devil which tries to enter my life.

While im texting her, i am not referring to her, im just acting like im talking to the devil directly and i believe she thinks that i am going crazy too.

I was never mentally ill, i had never murder on my mind and psychosis was never active in my family. 

Most of the times i start to drink immediately after waking up until i run out of whiskey.

My family members have no idea about that. The only person that knows about my downfall is this girl that refused to leave my life.

I am drunk right now and woke up 40 minutes ago.

I am just so scared and i dont want this psychosis to be a constant thing in the future. Thankfully its just when im drink for now.

- ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 76

Making a list of people I had harmed was not a particularly difficult thing to do.  They had showed up in my Fourth Step inventory: people towards whom I had resentments, real or imagined, and whom I had hurt by acts of retaliation.  For my recovery to be thorough, I believed it was not important for those who had legitimately harmed me to make amends to me.  What is important in my relationship with God is that I stand before Him, knowing I have done what I can to repair the damage I have done.

------------

I'm an alcoholic, three months sober with the help of a drug called Vivitrol. It's sort of like a receptor blocker for opiate users and alcoholics. In order to get the shot (it's once a month) you have to submit to and pass a breathalyzer and take a urine test to make sure you don't have any drugs in your system. If you do have opiates or alcohol in your system and get the shot I'm told you'll get very sick/risk overdosing/not good things.

When I went into my appointment for this months shot, I tested positive for methadone in my system. I don't use methadone so I thought she was joking but she wasn't. I explained that it must be a faulty test cup or something so they agreed to have me do the urine test for a second time but even on the second I tested positive.

After I tested positive even when I swore up and down I wasn't using the tone/direction of the conversation turned extremely accusatory. The nurse started with like ""you know the two people you shouldn't lie to are your lawyer and your doctor/don't deny it/maybe someone slipped it to you like a roofie (wtf)/you know you'll get sick if you get the shot with drugs I'm your system"". Everyones tone just turned so awful and me knowing I was clean and being accused with no one believing me was a horrible feeling. I've been accused of being under the influence while I WAS using and yeah no one believes it but being sober and accused was such a different type of hurt - it was like a cry wolf situation - I won't lie I cried and freaked out a bit.

In the end I found out from my boyfriend (who had the idea to Google this) that it was in fact a false positive due to the fact I was taking Benadryl for a while due to an allergic reaction I had been having - apparently that happens. Like eating poppy seed muffins. Even after they confirmed this with their pharmacist they asked me again if I was 100% sure I wasn't lying. 

I just wanted to speak about this because I didn't realize how awful it would feel to have no one believe you really are sober when people have previously given you all the benefit of the doubt/chances before. Afterwards they said they didn't see what the big deal was for me to get upset about it.

... and third, having thus cleaned away the debris of the past, we consider how, with our newfound knowledge of ourselves, we may develop the best possible relations with every human being we know.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 77

As I faced the Eighth Step, everything that was required for successful completion of the previous seven Steps came together: courage, honesty, sincerity, willingness and thoroughness, I could not muster the strength required for this task at the beginning, which is why this Step reads 'Became willing...'  I needed to develop the courage to begin, the honesty to see where I was wrong, a sincere desire to set things right, thoroughness in making a list, and willingness to take the risks required for true humility.  With the help of my Higher Power in developing these virtues, I completed this Step and continued to move forward in my quest for spiritual growth.

My boyfriend of 2 years who has raised my soon-to-be 3-year-old since before she could walk or talk (her bio dad isn't in the picture) - has told me he's over it. I can't get better.

I'll go 2 - 3 weeks without a drink then relapse. He's given me ample warning. I was sneaking alcohol behind his back (i.e. vodkas in water bottles). He caught on and he felt so betrayed, and we almost broke up then and there. But he decided to  give me another chance - long story short, it's been months and I haven't improved. I haven't been picking up after myself, picking up my share of the household chores, and worst off have been deferring almost 100% of the parenting to him. He works crazy hours from home (11 pm to 8 am) and I've been very unfair to him.

Yesterday was the last straw - I had ordered vodka behind his back and accidentally put it on his credit card like a dummy.  He kept quiet about it for like a week hoping I'd fess up (needless to say, I never did).

He told me yesterday he feels like he is a full-time single dad because whenever I'm drinking or hungover, I'm not doing my part to parent. He feels like he's taking care of TWO babies. He said he loves us both, but he's miserable and just can't do it anymore. He offered to put some money away in a savings or trust for my toddler - he said he still wants to be there and support us. I have temporarily moved my work from home station to my parents' house and the daughter and I have been staying here. He actually insisted we stay in the apartment until the end of the month (lots of tears were shed between the both of us) , but I told him I felt I should give him space and time to think. I've let him know after talking with several family members who all agree I have a major problem that I may check myself into an inpatient program.

I know I screwed up and I know trust is extremely hard to build once it's been tore down. But how do I let him know I'm serious this time? Is it too late? Have I screwed up one too many times? He is the love of my life - he saved me from a toxic situation and really helped build me up and want to do better for myself. The alcohol only happened because I experienced a loss in the family in October 2020 that I haven't been able to recover from. I really don't want to lose this man - when I'm sober, we never fight and he's such a great daddy to my toddler. She was crying the whole way to my parents'  house for him, like she knew there was something very wrong.

I am a mess. I can't eat, I can't sleep...I feel like I had a great life. We were a happy little family.

I have a soon-to-be 3-year-old toddler. Her bio father (ex husband) isn't in the picture. She has been raised by my current boyfriend of 2 years since before she could walk or talk. He really stepped in and I was blessed to meet him. 

I've tried to quit alcohol many times in the past year. But I always relapse. I've tried going several weeks at a time without a drink then slowly reinforcing myself to limited drinks, but once I start I can't stop. I always want more. I was already hospitalized in January with fatty liver but I can't stop. Every time I drink now I get terrible pains. I know I'm hurting myself. But I can't seem to quit it for good. 

I am not a good partner or mother when I drink. I've passed out while watching my toddler once (the lowest point of my life). Thankfully my boyfriend was working from home and was able to get us both to bed, but the incident scared my daughter (she kept saying ""Mommy sick"") and my boyfriend has been scared to leave the house or have a social life with friends or coworkers because he's worried I'll do something like this again. 

Every day is a struggle. I'm always hungover and have zero energy. Sneaking alcohol behind his back has been a huge thing for us. He gave me warning that he was tired of dealing with this and won't tolerate lying. Well I screwed up and ordered some alcohol (accidentally on his card). He kept quiet about it for a week, waiting for me to confess. Finally today he tried to break up with me. He said he loves us both but can't do this anymore. That he feels like a single full time father and like he has to care for two children. He has crazy hours (11 pm to 8 am) and when he's not working he's depriving himself of sleep to take the baby off my hands (I work from home 7 am to 3:30 pm weekdays). 

I temporarily moved back in with my parents (he was crying the entire time and insisting we stay through the end of the month since we paid August rent) but later on after a long talk with family members, I told him I was serious about quitting this time and I would check myself into a program if needed. So we went from broken up to having a few days of space. I truly believe this is contingent on whether I can prove I'm actually going to change and step up when it comes to parenting and not deferring everything to him. 

But I know it'll take a long time to earn his trust back. I'm so scared I'll mess up again. It's not worth it to me to lose him. I consider him my daughter's father and he's the one stable relationship I've ever had in my life. The one person I could turn to after a hard day. The person I can lean on and trust. I know it's in my best interest to quit this addiction not only for the sake of my relationship but for myself and daughter as well. She deserves a sober happy Mommy.

Good Evening, 
           I am not even sure where to begin with my tale… I am a bastard that descends from a 3rd generation lineage of highly functional European alcoholics on both sides… I have never found alcohol(8-14 drinks) to be a problem in my life as I can drink til the cows come home and I do not suffer from hangovers, argue or cause fights.  I have a very intense job, family and personal situation and  I seem to be able to coast over the ebb and flows of life so far without any issues (Knock on wood).

I am here today because I’m about to hit 40 and even though I don’t have a solid reason to stop… I need someone outside of my “bubble” to give me a “slap upside the head”….  I know that it will be all downhill at some point…. My blood numbers are all good, I’m fit and active….  It won’t last forever….

I have recently lost young, healthy friends that have been on the extreme end of “healthy” and it has me at that “stage” if you know what I mean…

Don’t be too hard on me!  I really appreciate you taking the time to read this “blubbery” and provide any and all insight!

I can tell she has been upset with me when I encouraged her not to do those things. The conversation went from her bragging about it to me asking why she decided to drink and drive.

These are the same steps that we ask everyone to work – no one graduates, no one gets promoted and, regardless of one’s time in the program, we’re all equals when we take our seats and start the meeting. We’re all here to support our primary purpose, which is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.”

Our program really is as simple as Dr. Bob wrote on his prescription pad in February 1937 – Trust God, Clean House, Help Others. That said, the devil’s in the details, and we all have to do the work and make our way through the steps in order to get better. When I first came into AA, all I wanted to do was stop drinking. But as is commonly quipped, take a drunken horse thief and sober them up and you have a horse thief. I was a sober horse thief, and it was devastating to discover I wasn’t the upstanding, outstanding, moral man of honor I thought I was. It took several years to clean up my messes and come to terms with who I really was; dishonest (step 1), a coward ruled by fear (step 4), zero integrity (keeping my word, and having my insides match my outsides – step 5), prideful and ego-driven (step 7), etc. It took many more years of practicing the principles for them to start being reflected in my character.

A HUGE turning point for me was when I was about 5 years sober and one of my best friends took me aside and lovingly but firmly said, “Steve, I wouldn’t give you a nickel for your sobriety.” That was devastating, but a huge wake-up call to stop being lazy, stop pretending that I knew everything, and come to terms with the fact I was a man of low moral character. I was rescued by our program – first as a way to get sober and break the brutal cycle of despair (steps 1-3), then a second time when I discovered the remainder of the steps were there to help rebuild my life, and especially my character. Today I see our program and the steps through a different lens - that the principles are there to hone and refine us, rebuilding our characters with the virtues necessary to be whole and complete – to be people of honor and have our insides match our outsides, to be responsible and disciplined, and be aware of who and how we are as make our way through life.

I came to AA to stop drinking, but I got WAY more than I expected – it’s not cliché to say I really did get my WHOLE life back, and the opportunity to live in a way that creates gratitude and respect.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,36591,public,self,Our Principles as Virtues,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/p3b61h/our_principles_as_virtues/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,

I went to one of their ""spiritual experiences"" almost ten years ago which a family member had been assisting. For me was a really shocking experience and if I rethink what happened there, it only makes me question their true intentions and means. They burnt a big cross in the groupal climax catharsis, and personally made me swear in front of a religious catholic idol (Crucified Christ) my father and some of his close friends, that I will keep beating myself to death using drugs in a totally vulnerable, open, position, because I couldn't enter into their sugested  healing psychotic state, or emotional catharsis. Then in other retreat now sugested by another close family member who supposedly thinks ""it can help me with my issues"" I was harassed and consciously triggered to feel exposed and ashamed of my intimacy, ( and this keeps ocurring constantly, but that's another subject) , by an unknown individual. At the ending prayer they made us swear again that we will not tell nothing of what we heard, said, made or saw in a kind of a biblical curse. All while in a highly sugestionable state. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a religious person, but most mexicans are. Even though, I think it worsened my situation.

1. I don't know if I'm an alcoholic, but I do know that I have a problem with alcohol. There are days when I tell myself that I won't drink, and it end up failing. I also struggle to stop once I start. I'm not sure if I'm an alcoholic, but if I am, I'm probably a ""high functioning alcoholic,"" as I have a good job and good relationships, and it hasn't yet negatively impacted my life other than by making me spend excessive amounts of money.
2. When the person in AA asked if anyone was new, it felt weird to say, ""Hi, I'm (name redacted) and I'm an alcoholic."" Honestly, I didn't want to add the ""I'm an alcoholic part,"" but I did because I didn't want to offend anyone or make people think that I'm judging them or that I think that I'm better than them. 
3. Can I still go to meetings if I don't want to give up alcohol? I didn't mention this in the meeting yesterday. I would like a community who knows what it's like to struggle with alcohol, and I presently don't have that community. But I don't want to give it up -- I just want to have more control over it and drink in moderation when I do drink. 
4. I'm not too enthused with how much religion is infused in the program (I'm an agnostic), but like I said, I would like a sense of community. 
5. Maybe I am an alcoholic. During the last half hour of the meeting, I kept thinking about how I wanted to drink some wine, so right after the meeting, I went to the store and bought a bottle. However, I am pleased to say that I only had a glass...I usually drink the entire bottle.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 77

As a traveler on a fresh and exciting A.A. journey of recovery, I experienced a newfound peace of mind and the horizon appeared clear and bright, rather than obscure and dim.  Reviewing my life to discover where I had been at fault seemed to be such an arduous and dangerous task.  It was painful to pause and look backward.  I was afraid I might stumble!  Couldn't I put the past out of my mind and just live in my new golden present?  I realized that those in the past whom I had harmed stood between me and my desire to continue my movement toward serenity.  I had to ask for courage to face those persons from my life who still lived in my conscience, to recognize and deal with the guilt that their presence produced in me.  I had to look at the damage I had done, and become willing to make amends.  Only then could my journey of the spirit resume.

I remember our honeymoon, one of the first times i tasted you, you gave me confidence, i could speak to whoever i wanted to and be the funniest guy in the room, this was when our relationship was at it’s best. This was when i was at university, i hadn’t tasted you seriously before this and it was enlightening, you gave me everything i ever wanted to have, confidence, long lasting sex, the ability to say things i’ve always wanted to say. This was the honeymoon. I think i’ve been searching for this feeling since then, but now, you just make me sick. 

Fast forward 6 years, you are still here, still giving me strength and courage when i need it. Now it’s not just the 10 beers one night every week to have fun, now it has become 24 beers everyday, and some spirits if it’s available. The few hours in the day when you are not here, i miss you and my body misses you more, so much that i start shaking ,become dizzy, i get nausea and headaches, my anus is like a tap, food is a nightmare, drinking water is like drinking something strange considering you are my poison, the late night texts to people i shouldn’t be talking to. You give me little white and black dots in my sight that float around when i need you, because i need you more and more. It’s impossible for me now to spend a few hours without seeing you, otherwise the anxiety and fear kicks in. You control me. Work is manageable but you are always in my mind

The greatness you used to give me has turned into a disaster, i don’t feel anymore desire for you, but i need you everyday, just to not feel sick anymore. You help me in my darkest moments, you help me when i want to kill myself, when i’m feeling shit and need to escape, you are the best excuse to everything, the friend that wants to go hiking or for a bike ride, no, you give me the simplicity of just putting you down my throat and everything feels better. 

After a while our relationship has become dysfunctional, i don’t want you anymore, but i need you. After searching that feeling that we had during our honeymoon, i think now we have come to a point where i need to divorce you, i don’t want you in my life anymore.  

Now i’m in hospital trying to get away from you, but i always think about you, i probably always will, but i don’t want you to make decisions for me anymore, or help me fuck up relationships, friendships..  I wish you the best and please try to not fuck up other peoples lives! Now after 3 days of being sober i feel the biggest guilt and embarrassment, and i want to make up for the past 6 years of my life i lost because of you.

Homeowner in the Bay Area, great job at amazing company, had decent relationships and a lot of fun traveling to Tahoe and international trips.  Published in top journals.

That is until my mother got diagnosed with terminal cancer and I got a Costco card.  I would go to Costco every couple days to buy the Kirkland $13 handle, and cruise through it.  Add some nice addictions to adderall, ambien, and klonopin, and I was constantly high.  I was able to maintain this for many years until a massive fuckup (along with a secret DUI that was exposed) and I was placed in Detox and then went to an IOP.  This is 2017.

I stayed sober for about 4 months until I landed at a Halloween party.  Drank a beer, smoked a joint.  I was on cloud nine.  Then straight back to the vodka.

Since then, I've had relatively short periods of sobriety followed by increasingly fucked up benders.  These are not black out then go to work, these are black out for a week and up in the hospital (and a couple times jail).  These relapses have landed me in inpatient rehab 3 times in 3 years.  I quit my amazing job as they were closing in on me.  Got a new job and had a bender, landed in the hospital.  They called it ""job abandonment.""  Seems a little fucked being liberal SF but it's my fault, take full responsibility.  I've gotten a new job and am out on medical now, likely to get ""laid off"" next week, as this wasn't my first bender.  Additionally, I've been living in Sober Living Environments for the last 2 years, and have been booted from 2 for my relapses.  Throw in another DUI for good measure.  There's a million other stories as you all know.  

I guess the reason I am posting is that I was reviewing emails from the years even when I was fucked up.  I seemed like a reasonable, happy, well adjusted human.  My life has been nightmarily fucked out for the last 4 years.  I have an empty, beautiful house that I don't live in because of this disease.  I am essentially going to lose my 3rd job (maybe).  Every time I relapse, it's another major trauma, and on some level, one could call is PTSD.  

I just can't believe how far I've fallen.  As a functional alcoholic I was a fun loving, charismatic dude that got his shit done.  Now I'm some broken, almost friendless, non-functioning human.

The moral inventory is a cool examination of the damages that occurred to us during life and a sincere effort to look at them in a true perspective.  This has the effect of taking the ground glass out of us, the emotional substance that still cuts and inhibits.

- AS BILL SEES IT, p. 140

My Eighth Step list used to drag me into a whirlpool of resentment.  After four years of sobriety, I was blocked by denial connected with an ongoing abusive relationship.  The argument between fear and pride eased as the words of the Step moved from my head to my heart.  For the first time in years I opened my box of paints and poured out an honest rage, an explosion of reds and blacks and yellows.  As I looked at the drawing, tears of joy and relief flowed down my cheeks.  In my disease, I had given up my art, a self-inflicted punishment far greater than any imposed from outside.  In my recovery, I learned that the pain of my defects is the very substance God uses to cleanse my character and to set me free.

Before that last week-long bender, I’d had almost 2 full years of not drinking. After that last week-long bender my entire life and everything I cared about was lying at my feet, broken.

The book talks about a jumping off place. At this point it was a binary decision: Live/Die. 

And I decided Die. I spent a couple of days researching the best way to do it. And on my way out to the garage to hang myself, I found myself on the phone with my sponsor. Ten minutes later he was at my house. He dragged me to a meeting.

That was my higher power doing for me what I could not do for myself. Grace.

In the meeting my sponsor dragged me to, I heard a woman say “Every morning, I wake up and give my alcoholism to my higher power.” And she made a little gesture of pushing something across a table. That gesture penetrated my brain. 

I’d never seen that woman in a meeting before, or since. I thought “I can do that, maybe.” 

The next day I went to the Men’s Meeting. Big Brian shared what was basically my story of multiple attempts over multiple years of trying half-assed to get sober. He was sober several years at this point and he said something that cut through my denial.

“The only difference in this time and all them other times is I learned how to pray.""

So I went home that night and knelt by the side of my bed and said “Please help me”. It was the first sincere prayer that I’d ever said. I didn’t know where the prayer was going or if anyone was listening, but I prayed anyway, because if it worked for Big Brain, maybe it would work for me.

“Please help me.” I have said that same prayer every day since. I don’t know why it works.

It wasn’t until after doing an honest and complete 4th and 5th Step that the obsession was finally removed. I learned that Steps 6 and 7 are the heart of Recovery. I did 8 and 9 to the best of my ability. I make prompt amends when I so something selfish or hurtful today. 

I try to stay in today. I try to not make everything about me. I don’t know why it works.

I tried for seven years to do it differently, only using the parts of the AA program that I felt right for me. I need every part of the AA program to remain sober one day at a time. I need the book, the meetings, the fellowship, the Steps, the prayers - all of it. 

Self-will didn’t work for me. Half-measures didn’t work for me. I’m grateful I learned that.

Even after I failed and failed and failed again, AA allowed me to keep coming back until I heard a couple of things that cut through my bullshit. And when I finally begged a higher power that I didn't really believe in for help, things began to change for me.

Today I have a life filled with love and serenity and joy. I don’t know why AA works for me.

I only know that it does.

The operation saw officers from the South Brisbane District and Road Policing Units perform 791 RBT’s resulting in four positive results for alcohol (with the highest reading 0.167%) and seven positive results for drugs.

I was hoping you guys could give me some perspective here and excuse me in advance for whining about my problems to you guys. Essentially I have mixed feelings over whether I'm overreacting to certain thoughts, or if I'm just now realizing the beginnings of an issue.  
 So essentially my uncle had problems with both alcohol and narcotics all of his life and passed of a drug overdose about a month and a half ago. Aside from the pain of the loss itself this has really stirred up some worry about my drinking. I was already noticing this was becoming a problem, yet was/possibly am sort of in denial about it when a couple people close to me commented that I was drinking a lot/too much. The rate at which I drink differs a lot, but if I get on a roll ill wind up drinking every day. Sometimes I tell myself I won't and then I allow myself to, and honestly it feels like a loss. I feel like the more I drink leads to wanting to drink more, and also leads to drinking more in a given day if I do drink. 

There's are times when I hardly drink at all (less so recently save for taking off a couple days or a week here and there) and I don't drink a crazy amount seeing as i'm a small guy, yet nonetheless it seems to me like I use life stress as a reason/excuse to drink. Anyways I don't think that's healthy. This is a similar trap I've seen most of my male family members fall into. Particularly my dad who's just now admitting to the drinking problem he's had most of his adult life. I think he'd be considered a functioning alcoholic. Duis in his 20s to his late 30s, hes 47 now and still drives under the influence. Some other problems would be drinking heavily after work, drinking at work, getting too drunk in situations that don't call for it, messy relationships, anger, immaturity etc.  
Anyways I'm noticing that I'm now starting to fall into a similar trap. That and I've already noticed a tendency to get addicted to other things or substances to distract/comfort myself from other life events. Like for instance when I was 19 I threw myself into video games for a regretful period and ended up playing for a ridiculous amount of hours and quitting my job. I smoked cigarettes and vaped for 4 years until just now quitting 9 months ago. I had an unhealthy relationship with porn for a while. Anyways I decided to quit all of these at one time or another, because I definitely used them as a crutch. Side note i feel like a lot of these dependencies were related to each other in one way or another . . . anyways now I'm noticing that whatever insecurities, weakeness, and ego issues I have are allowing/giving me an excuse to use alcohol as my newest, potentially most dangerous crutch. Yet it's almost like I'm waiting for something bad to happen before I allow myself to admit it will be/is a problem. Like I needed to get a dui the few times I've driven drunk, or I needed to get into that bar fight the time or two I almost did when I didn't just let something go. For me i think maybe ego and insecurity is the biggest issue of all, and I'm afraid I won't allow myself to grow as a person if I continue to find a crutch outside of the positive ones I have established. Like for instance I work out and try to take pride in my job.  
On the other hand I don't know if I'm being overdrammtic, because other people have it way worse in terms of life circumstance, and addiction issues. Part of me feels like kind of a dork for trying to make this into an issue maybe before it really is one. And maybe part of my ego thinks ""hey I'm not that guy, or I'm not going to be that guy."" I mean I really do like going out and drinking for the social aspect. Am I going to miss out on experiences every 22 year old is supposed to have if don't drink? I mean I guess I will but at the end of the day that sacrifice may be worth it in the long run. But meeting people's hard, hitting on girls is hard, dealing with stress is hard. Maybe I need to take people's advice on building the actual confidence instead of finding a crutch. Maybe revisit drinking later when I'm in a better spot, or maybe I should just learn from the mistakes of family and quit now instead of letting it seep back in ever. Like maybe I wont be able to figure out the problems that make me want to drink if I continue to drink. Or am I even the type of person who can drink casually without letting it become a problem? I feel like maybe i'm overthinking this though and maybe i'm missing a beat here.   
Okay thanks for reading if you did. I feel like I'm going around in circles a bit on this page and in my own head just flip flopping and being a bit chicken shit instead of making a clear distinction in my mind.

CC 12yo small batch is my choice of hammer. 90ish days dry is my best in 7-8 years. 

55 yo male. I have had mental health struggles for some time now and alcohol has not been my friend for a while. I have counted things forever making sure they are balanced and other compulsive behaviors. Borderline manic/depressive and don't feel the difference between happy, sad, angry. I have difficulty making friends because I qualify why they want to be my ""friend"". Have been in a positive role model/leadership positions for decades (w/much success for 25 years) but \~5 years ago had a complete break. Took a new job, fed a lot of promises, was assigned a list of ""quality"" sales leads, guy who hired me quit 2 months in, working through leads anything promising had already been closed and cashed in by another guy in the office who had been around a long time. Went to a ""client"" locale where there were a fair number of ""active"" quotes only to find a note on the door. They had been closed two years. My whole client deck and active leads had been pilfered by the other sales guy or were dead leads. 

I went back to my car and stopped functioning....completely, for hours. A friend who knew I was struggling with having gotten laid off and the new job not being what was promised knocked on my window sometime in the early evening. I've worked for myself since. Less jobs, I get paid direct, no lies, no benefits etc. I miss mentoring people, a lot. I think, that's really the only time I have been happy(ish). Teaching other people skills, coaching them through their challenges and watching them be successful. So easy to do for other people but not myself.  

Two weeks ago my little sister passed after battling breast, then other forms of cancer for some time. She never quit and I never knew what to say or do for her. I had to call my mums sister to tell her, my mum wouldn't. I told my aunt things I had never told anyone. My wife didn't take it well. My sisters husband was there always through the whole deal, they were the perfect balance for each other. He had no cares and she had a list for everything. I like to think they completed each other. Fuck I'm an idiot.

I've been to their house a few times now since. There has always been a Contego travel coffee mug near him every time and he is always ""topping it off"". I know. I know because there's a 40 in my car waiting until I get home. I know his pain. I want to smash something, scream at the top of my lungs,  lay down and quit. If I could stop breathing I would.

I am coming up on two years sober in just two weeks.  Nobody can say with 100% certainty that they won't fall down that particular hole again, but I feel very confident I will hit that anniversary.  Almost two years ago to the day was when I started tapering off of alcohol.

It's been a rough two years, for sure.  Stopping drinking right before the start of a pandemic was not easy.  Staying sober was not easy.  Home schooling children was awful. Discovering my daughter had pretty severe ADHD during the end of the last school year was not easy.  Having Type 1 diabetes is not easy (30 years now).  I am certainly not the only one who had a rough time of it.  I am sure I am not the only one to stay sober throughout either and to be counted as one of them is a moment of pride for me.  (And I am certainly not casting any judgement on anyone who may have slipped.  That is certainly not my place.)

And then there is my personal diagnosis with ADHD.  Specifically Hyperactivity and Inattentive.  

During the process of learning about my daughter's condition, I heard many assessment questions.  And almost all of them set off alarm bells. Yes, I do that.  Yes, that happens to me.  Wait, that is not ""normal?""

So I found a licensed professional and got all the assessments myself.  And what I learned was that yes, I have ADHD.  And due to my above average intelligence (not tooting a horn here, just stating part of the journey), I was able to power through many difficulties growing up.  I taught myself how to learn.  I developed so many coping mechanisms.  And through sheer force of will, I succeeded, got my college degree, and am reasonably successful in my field.  But nothing felt right.  Nothing felt done. And everything was a herculean effort to get anything done.  I felt lost and unfulfilled.  I mean, if I'm a ""genius,"" then why did I struggle so much?  It was depressing.  I was depressed all the time.

Rewind to my dalliances with alcohol starting after I graduated high school, then into the binge drinking of colllege.  It always felt so right to drink.  I never wanted to just drink myself into oblivion.  I just wanted ""that feeling.""  That feeling of bliss that came with the first drink.  And I wanted to maintain it.  Drinking to excess didn't start happening until later.

I got married.  I had kids.  Life happened and I had my drinking under complete control (or so it seemed).  Then I sprained my MCL and my managable alcoholism became very much unmanaged as I used it to treat the pain.  At that same time I found out my wife had had an affair.  Alcohol was now acting as a crutch to function.  And I certainly had a drinking problem, even if I didn't realize it at the time.  (for those curious, my wife and I sought counseling, reconciled, and are about to celebrate 20 years of marriage).

But I got clean.  I didn't hit rock bottom in the classical sense, but I certainly got scared that eventually something would happen.  I didn't want to end up in the hospital or worse.  So I tapered.  I quit.  I ended up exercising and weight lifting and getting fit.  I started drinking a lot of coffee, too. Turns out heavy caffeine consumption is also something untreated ADHD folks do. 

And then came the ADHD diagnosis very recently.  I had made a pact with my daughter that if I did have it, I would accept any medication the doctor thought appropriate and we would grow and go through this journey together.  Our relationship was not great beforehand.  And given both our diagnoses, this makes sense in retrospect.

So I took the prescribed adderall...     And something startling happened.  I felt that rush like I had just had a drink.  Except I didn't want more.  I didn't need to ""maintain.""  I felt focused.  Less fuzzy.  Present.  And most importantly, I simply stopped having any urge to drink while the medication was working.  I even stopped craving coffee.

What I've come to learn is that there is quite a link between alcoholism and ADHD.  My brain just doesn't make enough dopamine.  But drinking alcohol releases dopamine at first.  That's why I always felt more focused after a drink.  But we all know how that slippery slope goes.  So now, with the adderall (which is really just an amphetamine), it activates my dopamine production and actually relaxes me (unlike non-ADHD people).

It was very liberating to learn that the start of my abuse of alcohol was a biological one.  I feel totally exonerated for starting to drink.  It is important to note that I continue to own who I became while drinking and take complete ownership for my actions while drinking.  But that urge to drink...  I may never have had to go through what I went through if diagnosis would have been better in the 80s or 90s.  How much further I could have gone.  But the past is the past and I am now content with my life.

Things are much better now.  My daughter and I are growing and getting closer.  I see happiness on the horizon.  It's nice being more relaxed, less angry, more present.

So thank you for reading about the first two years of my journey through sobriety.  I look forward to a sober tomorrow.  Every day is just one more day and that is good.

If any of my story strikes a chord in any reader, I implore you to take an online assessment.  If that comes back leaning towards ADHD, find a professional that focuses on adult-diagnosis ADHD.  Get treatment if you want it and see if it helps.  It's never too late for self discovery.  It's never too late to feel better about your life.

- TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 77

As I continue to grow in sobriety, I become more aware of myself as a person of worth.  In the process, I am better able to see others as persons, and with this comes the realization that these were people whom I had hurt in my drinking days.  I didn't just lie, I lied about Tom.  I didn't just cheat, I cheated Joe.  What were seemingly impersonal acts, were really personal affronts, because it was people - people of worth - whom I had harmed.  I need to do something about the people I have hurt so that I may enjoy a peaceful sobriety.

I wasn't going to call her buff or even try to find out if it was only a buff but it worked, I called and 2 days later started the nightmare of withdrawal in a small detox center.

My mother drove me and promised to pick me up when I finished so I left my car at her place in the morning and she took me in

 My time came and I was discharged but I had decided since I happen to only live 15 minutes from this center and it was beautiful sunny day that I would walk home. 

I arrived home about 20 minutes later, came into see my with and daughter but my son was with my mother and had stayed with her the night before, she just happened to text my wife and said he's ready to come home now to which my wife replied oh op just arrived home he'll come down and get him since he has to get the car anyways.

2 minute walk down the road and my mother is raving about how I scammed her and my wife scammed her into watching our son, her grandson.
How why should he have to be in her care for 10hrs at a time when he comes to visit.

At this point I was only about 45 minutes to 1 hour out of detox but shes convinced I got out the day before and my wife set her up to keep our son over night. 

I'm baffled, she said alot of things in front of my son who is old enough to understand what's being said and his whole demeanor changed, it tore my heart out to watch a young boy go from bright and bubble to tears and sadness in minutes when he learned is grandmother doesn't want to have a sleepover or spend a day with him, only a couple hours when she decides. I fear whats going to come of this he adores his grandmother and constantly wants to spend anytime he can with her but now it seems she doesn't. I'm perplexed into a state of wanting to scream, drink it all down to no emotion again or cut ties until a better time comes around.

I went to a meeting this evening and got my first chip but couldn't speak on it. I'd just cry in frustration and waste time.

My wife just wants to cut her out completely but I think she wants to do that to me to.

This has been my first 12 hours out, so far I haven't had a drop and I'm looking forward to the first meeting I can get myself into tomorrow and probably as many as I can physically get my ass into a chair because my want is pushing had and the fight is getting harder.

She always was kind of a drinker, but after she found out about her mothers cancer a year ago, its a bottle of wine a day or so. Now after her death, its a bottle of wine and accusations that Im all bad and dont support her - everyday. But I knew that after death of her parent she ll be spiraling and asked her to go to therapy. I found her a therapist, wrote support letters, attended the funerals, arranged other help. Tried to make her better with positive activities - numerous times. But nowadays she is either angry and picky, or drunk. She does not acknowledge the problem (same as her alcoholic narcissist father btw, whom we plan to send to a rehab) and gets mad when I mention that she uses wine to evade the problems. 

I really cant bear it anymore. I dont have anything positive from this relationship for a long time - all my proposals are being dismissed, I forgot what is sex and what is a smile. She accuses me of anything and denies my right to be sad or silent after her angry outbursts. I really did everything I could to help her - she just dont want to accept anything. 

How should I behave? I am really thinking about an ultimatum - either its me and a therapy, or its wine but without me. I tried to make agreements, to talk to her in an positive way, but it became impossible. I want to give her a chance.

The alcohol would either numb the pain, loneliness, or whatever I was feeling, or it would be enough to act as a kind of 'mental block' or 'limiter' for my brain, where it would just shut my mind down and stop it from being able to think about things for a while. Eventually it would also help by sending me to sleep. Just over a couple of months ago I had a mental breakdown, drank heavily to try and cope with it, and the short version is the state I was in ended up costing me the friendship of my closest friend, the most important person in my life. Since then I forced myself to quit, partially because I of how drinking had ended up in me emotionally hurting someone I care deeply about, and partially as a way for me to try and change, hoping it might help toward redemption and a chance at earning back my friends forgiveness and friendship. 

I successfully managed to cut off cold (a horrid week of withdrawals), and have managed to stay off ever since. However it's all feeling in vain and I'm losing hope, it seems the change is too little too late, and the thought and worry that I can't ever save or repair the friendship is adding more and more to my depression. Each day I'm struggling more and more to cope with my thoughts and pain, without drinking I no longer have any 'block/limiter' to numb my pain or stop my thoughts. The whole day my mind is full of thoughts over what happened, regret, pain of loss, worry over what will happen, and in the last few weeks suicidal thoughts (not immeditate, but a feeling that it's only a matter of time if I can't save the friendship). It feels like my mind is under a constant migrane being crushed with all thoughts constantly swirling around in there at the same time. Sometimes I can barely walk or stand as it just overwhelms my head and I can't function, a few times I've ended up dropping to my knees. At work I've had to go out back as I've just mentally frozen or broken down, and when getting back home I've just collapsed on the bed not able to move as the thoughts get too much. I've barely been able to sleep, the thoughts constantly keeping me awake or waking me up in the form of nightmares over what happened.

I'm starting to think that if stopping drinking wasn't enough of a change and it's never going to help me earn back that friendship then what the hell is the point? Why don't I just drown my sorrows away to at least stop the pain and depression I've been suffering? But then I remember I stopped it because it contriubted to the state I was in that night when I emotionally hurt my friend, and that thought keeps me off of it. I'm doing it for her, even if she never realises it or even cares about it. I just don't know what else to use instead of alcohol, I need something to stop my thoughts, numb me, and shut down my mind, I'm going insane and I don't think I can keeping going on for much longer. I've tried forcing myself with distractions, TV, games etc, but I can't get into anything anymore (a lot reminds me of my friend which is why), I've tried herbal teas, legal botanical narcotics (smoking blue lotus etc), natural &amp; OTC aids (Kalms etc), anti-depressants (perscribed), I'm in therapy, I've tried crisis lines / online support, and none of it is helping, I continue to get worse each day. The only thing I've found that's helpful have been some strong sleeping tablets, however I can't use them everyday as I get resistant to them, so I only end up able to use them for about 1-2 nights per week. I just have no idea what to do or how to cope, there doesn't seem to be anything that works in the way alcohol did.

We took some time a part(month). Now, He comes over often to meal prep cook because he now lives in a small room owned by an older lady who put out a Craigslist ad. 

Recently, his film(he’s a videographer) career has been taking off. This is his passion and it makes him really happy. He’s been working out and eating healthy. He has been going to AA meetings and has a sponsor as well. Things were going well. However, his video  shoots went from baby showers and kids birthday parties to now music videos. These have him out all night and of course, around drugs. Before this, I was worried he was focusing more on his career than his sobriety. 


This weekend, he was flown out to New Orleans to shoot a video. When he got back, I noticed he looked tired but a different kind of tired. My intuition told me something was off but I left it alone because I had no evidence. Until, I smelled his breath when he tried to give me a kiss. I confronted him. 

At first, he was like “The smell of the people around me got on me” which was obviously a lie. Then he asked if I wanted him to leave and I said yes. I called him after he left because I was pissed and he finally admitted he did drink. He said “ I went out of town and had a drink because I felt good”  very nonchalant. Then, he apologized for lying and said it was only a mistake and he was good the entire trip he just had a relapse and that recovery is not linear but overall he’s doing good . He said he’s not going to beat himself up but move forward. After crying about how tired he was of being an alcoholic and promising he is going to work to put his sobriety before his career. We just fell asleep. 


I woke up feeling blah. Like maybe I’m not hard enough on him? Did I let him get away with it? Is mistakes a part of the process? I’m going to therapy and working on myself as well and this whole alcohol situation is a rollercoaster. I have no family support so I go to Al Anon and for the first time to this thread :(

I already told him our contact is contingent upon his sobriety… is this just a minor mistake and I’m overreacting?


For any recovering alcoholics, is this normal behavior? Is investing this much time (he works a corporate full time and do film) into his career potentially dangerous while he’s so fresh into his recovery? He’s pushing himself to get wealthy so fast which “hustling”to get financially ok is fine under normal conditions but we are not in a normal situation.

He claims he needs to just be strong around alcohol instead of trying to avoid it at functions. I think he should try to avoid the presence of it all together while he’s so new to recovery.",True,False,False,alcoholicsanonymous,t5_2s3xd,36497,public,self,A question from the other side: my partner just relapsed and I have no idea what to do.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/p10g12/a_question_from_the_other_side_my_partner_just/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,
