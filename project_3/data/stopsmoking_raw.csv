A few weeks ago my friend left a Big Bar at my house, which is around 5%, which we both thought was light. After buying one of my own, and realizing it's 10mg/1% and I've been smoking 50mg hits, I threw that shit away.

So 4 months back, I wanted to quit again and decided to log my whole journey so I used to log trigger and time when I smoke and over the the weeks data I see clear pattern and my mind was more aware of pattern and triggers, so after a week I decided I will try to distract myself with different techniques(dancing, drinking water, talking to friend, breathing exercise etc..), initially first week 80% of time my cravings were much powerful then my mind ... but I was keep doing and exercising the same practice and target one trigger at time( eg: I will not smoke after any meeting ) and overtime I realise that my mind is more and more aware of my habit that helps me to make my judgement to smoke or not on certain trigger... after couple week of practicing the same I was manage to smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day to 1-2 cigarette a day and now I smoke occasionally. And I thought what helps me can help others as well to control smoking, so I started building app for that cause, in first app version I am supporting below features

1. set daily smoking goal 
2. log every smoke with triggers 
3. analyse your trend - trigger wise, day wise and will provide you comparison based on past data  
   
  So anybody want's to give initial feedback to this android app? please comment if you want to test it out this app :)

And Im starting to worry.. I saw my psychiatrist. She said I dont need meds, I should keep exercising every day, practising breathing exercises etc.. How to decide to go on meds or not?

Let me clarify:

You can use Nic patches, or any other type of Nic replacement. You can switch to vaping, you can use gum. Etc... The point is, those are all substitutes. Even if you're just chewing a mint gum, that's a substitute: one habit for another. You're not kicking the habit, you're just satisfying it in a different way.

To draw an analogy, your kid really wants McDonalds. He's throwing a tantrum, wants a cheeseburger *RIGHT NOW*. You can't get him McDonalds. Instead, you make him a cheeseburger at home.

In that sense, you didn't kick his habit of wanting McDonalds. He'll still want McDonalds. You just patched it with something he doesn't want but will quiet him for a bit, until the next day when he throws another tantrum for McDonalds. And it will be an endless cycle. 

Similarly, you aren't kicking the habit when you substitute it for a piece of gum or seeds. On a good day, it will distract you. On a bad day, it will aggravate you more. At the end of the day, you're still living under the shadow of a cigarette. You're under the mercy of a cigarette, and how much you can control yourself for that single craving.

Multiple that by however many cigarettes you smoked in a day. 

---

What I'm getting at is, then you start tallying up. You start keeping count. *Okay today I fought off 15 urges. Tomorrow, I will have fought off 30 urges. A week from now, I'm a week smoke free.*

Your life **revolves** around the cigarette, your cravings, and your resistance. You took a habit that was a big deal to you, and made it into an even bigger deal after you tried to quit it. Hence, you're still a slave to it, even after you stopped it. 

---

On the other hand, you hear about and see people who were a pack a day or more smokers for 10, 20 years. And suddenly, they dropped it. No visible withdrawals, no keeping tally. You ask them when they stopped, they couldn't tell you the exact date. But They just know it was a while ago. Hell, some might even pick a cigarette once in a blue moon because they're out on a vacation at a bar or something. But they're no more of a smoker than anyone else, and they won't fall back into it.

Even smoker mothers, who get pregnant. They drop smoking in a heartbeat, and don't think twice about it. Again, because of priorities. 

This has nothing to do with ""addictive personality"" or any of that. It comes down to one thing:

their mindset shifted. They had other priorities come up. Maybe they just didn't want to smoke anymore. Maybe they suddenly had a baby. Maybe they met someone. Maybe they had a stroke. And in that sense, smoking was no longer a priority or even a thought. Smoking because so minuscule that they didn't even think about it. They didn't keep a tally, they didn't fight off an urge. They just moved on, because they had more important things.

Today marks 3 weeks since I stopped smoking. I'm on 25mg patch and sometimes I miss smoking. I miss listening to music and smoking a cigarette, as a matter of fact a few days ago I was anxious and panicking and had a fear of depression and OCD returning ( I'm diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and have had depressive episodes before ) and all I was thinking about in that moment is to smoke but I didn't. I'm glad I didn't but sometimes I feel like I want to, I somehow miss it even though life is better now, no more anxiety over how many cigarettes I have left or other things, I have more time to do things I love and to talk to loved ones. 

I was a smoker for 2 years and by the end of it, I used to smoke around 20 cigarettes per day. Sometimes even 1 pack and a half or 2. I've may even got acid reflux or maybe GERD because of smoking since the last two months I've been having problems with acid returning to my throat.

I know that smoking is an addiction and that there's absolutely nothing about it that's worth going back but how can I remove that feeling of comfort that it gave me ( or maybe it truly didn't give me anything at all ) ?

I’ve been a cigarette smoker for about a year and a half, a habitual weed smoker for around five years, and a fairly regular drinker for at least the last three years. I take prescribed medication for depression and anxiety, which I started during the pandemic when I was in a particularly low place. One of the guys I tour with quit cigs with me two weeks ago, and we’re going strong on the no-cigs front, but here’s where I could really use some advice: 

I’m struggling to find a healthy way to cope with the extra anxiety that comes from nicotine withdrawals - I keep leaning on other vices more to push past the urge to buy a pack of cigarettes. I’m smoking more weed, drinking more, and overeating every night. 

I play a lot of brewery/bar gigs so alcohol is always free and easily accessible and I’ve already noticed myself drinking more at shows to take the edge off that I’d usually rely on nicotine to take care of. Yesterday, I opted not to drink during the show and I felt so restless when I got home - couldn’t sleep, walked for an hour, tried to get some work done - I ended up caving and getting stoned to calm down. I want to find balance and distance myself from all the shitty vices I’m leaning on. Do you have any suggestions for quitting nicotine without shifting the weight of your personal discomfort to other addictive things? Thank you!

I have horrible anxiety already and the additional anxiety around my health and the way I smell, am perceived etc. is too much to take. 
Tobacco is absurdly expensive in Australia and I'm wasting my money on something that is going to kill me   and is worsening my physical capabilities. 
I'm young and I don't want to keep putting it off because ""I've got time"". I don't want to be digging my own grave any more. 

I am done. I'm ready to get rid of this shit no matter what. I previously read Alan Carr's book and it was like an actual switch being flipped. I quit for a year until a particularly bad break up. I had that first puff and the work was all undone. I didn't even crave the nicotine, I just wanted something to fill the empty space. 

Does anyone have suggestions/tips for how to replace the one thing I think a cigarette gives me - a way to passively kill time? It doesn't require focus, my thoughts can still bounce around without taking away from the task at hand and there's a clear beginning and end, kind of a goal to  complete. It's satisfying when I'm by myself and anxious, not really able to collect my thoughts and it gives me something to lean on socially when I'm nervous (either to kind of stimulate myself or to act as a social buffer? I don't know how to explain it). 
Things like stress balls or fidgetty things don't work because they're aimless and also usually socially inappropriate. 

It would also be great to hear from anyone that's had success re reading the Easy Way to Quit.

Husband (39) also a lifelong smoker who has only attempted to quit once, was recently injured and has been hospitalized.  He is now two weeks quit and perhaps two weeks from coming home with physical limitations (i.e. won't be getting outside for smoke breaks) and will be out of work for perhaps a year (i.e. budget is going to get very tight).

He feels pretty okay on the non smoking aspect of things. Hes not in the best physical shape overall, but I can see a positive improvement in his skin and eyes which might be directly related to not smoking one to two packs daily for two weeks. I never thought he would quit, but this may be it for him.

I have good experience with Allen Carr and the Smoke Free app. But I am a bit scared, as I am now unprepared and spontaneous to stop smoking. I really want to make it and I know how great it is to be a non-smoker.

Do you guys have any experience with quitting smoking due to a temporary illness?

Bottom line is that with recent federal legislation even vaping is astronomically expensive now. While I think its ridiculous we vilify vaping so much, I'm pretty much left with no choice but to quit. Partly because I dont want to allocate more per month to nicotine than I already spend, and partly because it pisses me off that congress can just control my life and what I consume.

My biggest hurdle is probably obvious to you by now, but I genuinely dont care about the negatives of smoking. I still love everything about it, even if I know that objectively I will benefit from not using it. 

Honestly what I'd like to hear is the positives yall have felt from quitting? Hopefully thatll re-frame my mind because past attempts to quit have all failed in under 24 hours for me. I think I fail to remember what it was like to not be tethered.

I told myself if I could make it through 3 days I'd be okay; those first 72 hours were pretty tough and I was hit hard by nicotine cravings but I like a challenge. Plus once I'd started the daily streak of no smoking I didn't want to break it. 
The morning after my third day, I had a dream just before waking (side note; I've been sleeping so well, even since the first day, and feel really rested). I dreamt I woke up on a beach, took in a big breath of fresh air, and looked out at the water, which was shimmery pink and blue, it was sunrise. I got up and walked along the shoreline, I walked along a pier, and said how I really felt like going swimming. I started back along to the beach, and said how I love not smoking and how I love the mornings now. I felt joyful, saw a child playing, thought how beautiful everything was. (Weirdly my ex was there the whole time and I was talking to them, I've only had bad dreams about them before but they didn't disrupt the peace of it at all, they just followed me around, felt calm for them to be there). 

Then I woke up irl, and immediately got out of bed and went for a jog, without having to force myself at all, I really wanted to and had a bunch of energy. I did the same today.
It was a simple little dream but I guess having that sentiment come through in a dream is a nice feeling. I've quit quite a few times before but always ended up having 'just one'. Hopefully this will be the final time, and the fact I've quit drinking will likely help.

You might remember me.  I posted back when I initially quit.   

I quit in early August, not a single cig in over two months.   I am currently battling cancer and after discovering I am peeing blood again, when I shouldn't be, I got weak and bought a pack.  I smoked about half the pack, and I feel really ashamed of myself.

I am 60 with bladder cancer.  After having my tumors removed, my doctor scoped me again and noticed some ""pieces"" that he missed.  Now I am scheduled to have that same operation again.  First time I had complications and actually had to cath myself a few times.  The idea of doing that all again...  Anyway, at work yesterday I noticed I was peeing blood again, which should not be happening since I was ""healing so well"" according to the doc.  I went home early from work and started my leave early, since my operation is in a few days.

I don't consider myself ""starting back"".  Now that I have calmed down from my initial panic, I am like ""damn, what have I done? Did I REALLY just start again after going through all that to quit?"".  I am not gonna let this beat me.  I am NOT letting cancer have me, I will NOT let cigarettes' get me either.  

It is just hard and depressing.   Really don't have anyone to talk to about it either.  My co-workers are friend-like, but mostly just acquaintances.  All of my blood relatives have already died, my lifelong friends (only really only had two) are both dead....   My wife is a drunk and I ""think"" somewhere in there she cares, too busy being self absorbed to worry about me.  But, for her part, I understand, her Mom is suffering from dementia and she is her care giver.  She has toned down the drinking and is trying to take care of her, so I don't give her any crap.  Can't really talk to her, but not really upset wit her as she IS going through alot herself.

I plan on resuming my quest to beat cancer and stay off cigarettes.  I really don't know why I am posting this, just bored and lonely I suppose.  Not really seeking pity or anything, just felt like unloading a little.  I actually feel better writing this.  My cats like me though, and they never judge...  They just stare...  and wait...

Today—almost out of nowhere—I developed a persistent dry cough that is somewhat annoying. I have no other symptoms. I don’t have a cold, and I seriously doubt it’s any type of virus. My question for this (very experienced) community is, did any of you experience the onset of coughing symptoms weeks after quitting? What was your experience and how did you manage through it?

No that has seemed to pass by I have this sadness about me recently. It’s not nice and is a pretty strong feeling.

I've previously stated that I was going to post weekly for three months in my Past posts.   


[Introductory](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/)

[Three Weeks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pmvom4/three_week_update/)

&amp;#x200B;

And then I stopped. The reasons I stopped were that I got insanely busy at work and didn't have a lot of time off, but mostly it's that I just don't even think about smoking anymore. To sit here and write these posts is something that would have to be scheduled these days or I just won't get around two doing it. It's wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

My Ferrari Fund is now over $1000, I will certainly be getting one at some point in the future thanks to cigarette money saved. Still a ridiculous concept to me that not smoking can pay for a supercar over 15 or so years. But on the other hand, last year had someone told me that, it probably wouldn't have mattered. When I was a smoker, the idea of being a non-smoker actually seemed way more unattainable than a supercar. I'd always be able to afford one of those some day, although I'd neevr buy one without a fund set up for it like this. But not smoking? That seemed like a fantasy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now though, I am a non-smoker. I don't think about it at all, I'm not tempted to have a smoke during all the natural cues I used to have (After food, first thing in the morning with coffee, commercial breaks, in the car, during intermissions.... I used to smoke constantly, all of these cues are really just excuses). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to promise to keep writing these because I probably won't, but I can't express my gratitude to this sub enough for recommending Allen Carr. I learned so much about my addiction and the lies/delusions it was telling me. Smoking consumed me and didn't let go for all of those years. It feels so good having my life and mind back from that awful, awful disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I can quit, and get to this point of not needing, or even wanting a cigarette, anyone can. And I'm serious, I wouldn't take a puff of a cigarette if paid $10000 right now. I don't want to be a smoker ever again.  It's just a matter of finding the right tools that work for you. I wish I'd have found Allen Carr sooner because that was instant to me. It really was easy to quit with those tools. I'd recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it. Get the audiobook, grab your smokes, and listen to it all in one shot. Just set aside 5 hours of your day and you'll easily stop smoking. At least that's how it worked for me.

Quick background: got addicted when I was in 6th grade and smoked a pack a day for 10 years.   


 Anyhoo, I've decided that it was time to quit this year as I wanted to be able to see my future daughter grow and go to college and whatnot. So I started with a Juul which went well and I was able to kick it off completely after 3 days or so but after a while, I've realized that my nicotine addiction got more intense and I was consuming more nic than I was w normal cigs, so I switched to freebase juice (lower nic levels) with a pod mod device.  


After that point, I've decided to gradually decrease my nicotine intake until it's 0mg, and I was able to decrease it to 3mg in 2 weeks but then I realized the flavor had played a big role in why I vaped too much juice in a day, so I've ordered a special juice that had no flavor in it. It was a bit weird but I got used to it and reduced my daily vaping amount by half.  After that, I was convinced that I was pretty close to quitting completely very soon.   


In the meanwhile, my Doctor had put me on a new medication called ""Wellbutrin XL"" for my ADHD treatment. I've started taking it and after 3 days or so, it was a Thursday afternoon, I just had my lunch and I've noticed that it's been more than 6 hours since the last time I took a hit from my vape and was pretty amazed by the fact that I didn't even think about it during that time.   


So I quickly reached for my vape to take a hit and just thought to myself, ""why don't you wait and see how much longer you can go vape-less?"" and I liked the idea so I put it back.  And BINGO, that was the last time, months had passed and I've never touched it again. Threw all my vape and smoking stuff away and never looked back.   


All that process that I've just told you about took me about a month and a half, from starting to Juul until having my last vape drag. But that doesn't mean that you can do it in 1.5 months as well, I was pretty aggressive and fast about it so it didn't take me long but it's different for everyone.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,129044,public,self,60 Days SMOKE-FREE!

Starting in 2020 I tried to stop several times - most attempts lasted a few weeks before I would get triggered (usually by drinking socially with friends who use nicotine). This most recent time I decided to use nicotine pouches to help quit. I think the hardest part for me was the hand-to-mouth habit, so I figured I would try to break that without dealing with nicotine withdrawal on top of it. I started at 6mg pouches using three per day and over a couple of weeks tapered down to one 3mg pouch daily until a month ago when I stopped completely. It was pretty easy and after a couple of days I didn’t really think of it or miss smoking or nicotine at all. However, the past two days it’s been all I can think about and the urge to go buy a disposable vape is almost unbearable. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has any advice to help get through this part without relapsing again? 

I should also add that I just made a cross country move. I stopped vaping just before leaving and used the pouches during the road trip and stopped using nicotine completely just before arriving in my new city. I thought it would be easier since I don’t have anything here that I associate with vaping (unlike before when I was used to taking smoke breaks at work with my co-workers and drove past my favorite vape shop frequently, etc.)

The first week is horrible. The addiction makes sure of that. It tries to trick you into ""just one more smoke"", and everything is just aggravating and not fun. BUT that one week at the beginning is worth everything else that follows.

\--

By my second week I remember getting in my boyfriend's car after he picked me up and turning to him; ""Wow you smell really nice today!"" I said, ""Are you wearing cologne?""

And he replied, ""I am. I wear it every day. I always wondered if you liked it.""

This floored me. Cigarettes stole my ability to smell how amazing my boy smelt. And within the first two weeks I was able to get that back. And that experience set the tone for the rest of my quitting experience.

Just found this subreddit. I was addicted to cigarettes for a couple years, I smoked a pack a day for maybe a year, cut down a lot by rolling my own and vaping, and eventually fully quit sometime last year. I've bought a couple packs since then, usually smoked part of it, remembered how shitty it feels, and gave the rest away. 

I work at a restaurant and many of my coworkers smoke or vape and would offer me some. At first I didn't  see an issue with it but now I'm stuck with this problem/habit where for many months, I smoke almost like I'm addicted to it Friday- Sunday when I work (I do doubles all weekend and then get 4 days off lol) where on a ""good day"" I'll only have one cigarette but sometimes up to like 4 or 5 especially if I drink which we can do for free there when we close. And then go through withdrawals every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday, but my bf smokes cigarettes and recently I've been bumming some from him on those days and been close to being fully physically addicted again a couple times and made myself stop for a week or so before inevitably bumming more. 

I have no mental issue with going days/a week without nicotine if I'm not around it, I've done it very often. But I recognize the amount I'm still smoking negatively affects me almost every day and I've tried every strategy I know of to stop. I set up reward systems for going without for a week/2 weeks/a month, I journaled about how it makes me feel, I got hemp cigarettes, I told people not to offer to me. And even then I can't stop myself from asking at least my bf (we work together) at least once a day when I work. 

Any tips you can think of to give me? Any media you think would be helpful for me to consume?

I keep trying and keep failing, and every time I failed I said the same words ""just 1 smoke."" There was never just one. One quickly turns to two, two to three, and before I know it I'm at a pack a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember the first cigarette I smoked. It was 2018 and I was my first week into med school. We were celebrating with some drinks and my roommate pulled out a pack of cigarettes. I had never smoked cigarettes in my life, never wanted to do it neither. Whenever someone offered I would say ""no thank you"" and usually leave because I couldn't stand the smell of cigarettes. However, while a tad bit too tipsy I took a cigarette and lit it up. And oh man that rush that gets you the first time...it was incredible. Weeks went by and I smoked a cigarette here and there, nothing too serious, but then came the end of our first semester...exams were nearing, stress was high and I needed a damn smoke...and then another one....and then, of course, another one. Quickly in a matter of weeks I started smoking a pack a day till the end of that semester.

  
Then came my first break, had about a week off before next semester started and in that week I managed to quit. Barely touched another cigarette for the next 7 months, even my smoker friends would say ""No"" even when I'd repeatedly bother them for one. Then came fourth semester! The start of 2nd year with the largest hurdle over (1st year, particularly 3rd semester). I was at an all time high, stress was at an all time low, things were looking up! And then I thought, ""well damn, a cigarette would be good right now."" 

And that's where the next 2.5 years of my life went downhill with smokes. Now I wasn't smoking because I was stressed, I was smoking because I was happy! In a fantastically idiotic fashion it meant I was smoking all the time for every possible reason! Again, within a few weeks I was at a pack a day! At least this time I had thought of an alternative. I was going to get a vape! I got some Juul with pods and started tossing those back 2 - 3 pods a day. It was great because I didn't have to leave my room to hit a Juul like I had to with a cigarette so I could just do it every minute of every day! Wake up in the morning and still in bed? Juul. Taking a shit? Juul. About to jump into the shower? Juul! Juul, juul, juul all the time. 

And this kept up for the remainder of my 2nd year with really no attempts to quit. At times I went back to cigarettes. The feeling of lighting one up and taking the first puff. The delicious taste of ash in my mouth. I'm honestly not quite sure what it is, but there was just something about smokes that vapes just could not replicate.

My 3rd year though was where my eyes opened and I made several attempts, and of course, failed every time. 3rd year is when the game changes a bit. It's no longer locked in the library or in your room studying. No, now you're on the floor, working, interacting with patients and their families. I ran into a few attending physicians that smoked, you could smell them a mile away when they came back from their ""break"".  I wanted a break. I took my breaks. Cigarette in the morning after waking up, before I showered to be sure I didn't smell before I got to the hospital. Cigarette after morning rounds, didn't want my residents and attendings to get a whiff. Cigarette after lunch. Cigarette on my way home. Cigarette here, cigarette there, cigarettes everywhere! 

Saw my patient dying of COPD exacerbation? ""Damn I could use a smoke after that..."" Patient with COPD and COVID has their heart stop in the ICU and I had to do chest compressions? ""Fuck I need a smoke."" How does that make sense? I don't know, you tell me...

It's like there are these little cigarette monkeys in my head that start running around whenever they get a chance. I had always thought quitting was ""easy"". ""I just have to stop,"" I would say. I can start using smokeless tobacco like snuff pouches to wean myself down. I even tried that, went from using 1 8mg pouch every so often, to popping 2x6mg pouch every now and then (somehow managed to up the dose see? 8 just wasn't cutting it! And before I knew it I would be popping pouches while smoking cigarettes or hitting a vape. 

But don't worry. ""It's easy."" 

""It's easy."" Is the worst thing I have ever told myself about anything. Ever since 3rd year ended a few weeks ago I have had a lot of time to sit and think. It seems almost universally true in my life that when I say ""it's easy"" I get lazy. ""Losing and keeping weight off is easy!"" Proceeds to put on 30 lbs. ""Putting on muscle is easy!"" Proceeds to slack at the gym and atrophy like nobody's business. ""Damn this class is really easy"" Proceeds to get lazy and by some heavenly blessing still manage to do well. 

""Easy"" is the worst word I had ever learned. Nothing is easy. This time I have convinced myself that this is one of the hardest things I will ever do. I need to quit and to do that I need to stay vigilant. No lapses, no relapses. If not for myself then for my patients.

I am at 96 hours. I no longer feel like murdering everyone around me. I think this is going well but I don't think it's going easy.

I was the one who quit first. Had a health scare because my lungs were pretty fucked. They were a smoker at the time but I think that kind of banged some clarity into them, so they quit. We did together you could say.

Now yesterday they mentioned that they were on a smoke break. And they mentioned it again too. They did it so casually.. I'm sure they know that it would have upset me. Do they think it's cool and wanna show off so that's why they mention it, despite my feelings? Before they tried to quit my friend had a group they smoked with and romanticized it too.

I haven't talked to them about it. I just ignored it as if they didn't say it. I feel like if I bring it up I will seem over-controlling or something. I know it's their decision so I can't be angry at them but it makes me sad.

I was holding on away from the urges but this just made me wanna start again too.

I was a pack a day smoker for about 8 or 10 of those years. The last year I am around 15-20 a day. Tried a few different strategies such as quitting at night. Quitting in the morning. Quitting during the day. Quitting on the patch or lozenge. Quitting while I am off work. Quitting while I am working. I am on champix now. I tried it years ago and it felt like it worked. Like I didnt feel like smoking but did anyways because I wasnt ready to quit. Ive been on it for 2 weeks today and it doesnt feel as helpful as before. Like it kind of makes me forget about smoking but theres still mad cravings every so often. I went 30hrs until this afternoon and cracked and bought a pack for no other reason because I am a little bitch and was being an idiot. I originally felt like if I could just get 1 day under my belt I would be able to beat this. Now I just dont know what to do or feel. Like youre supposed to pick a quit date within 2 weeks of champix and im there now and am worried it will not work if I keep smoking. Im a sober alcoholic (4 years tomorow 🤜🤛) and when I realized that I ""got"" sobriety was when I stopped counting the days I was sober because the time in doesnt matter only the today does. Im trying to have that make sense with smoking but it seems like its all about how many days it is equals your success. I dont know if that makes any sense. Alcohol for me was an acute disease. Absolutely binge drinking wrecklessness that could of killed me or anyone else in my path at any time. Smoking is this chronic addiction that takes a little bit at a time but isnt as near term devastating as alcohol is. So it almost doesnt seem ""that bad"" or that I must quit sooner than later even though I want to. Enough is enough.

I’ve tried to quit a few times before, but I’ve always gone right back to it. I think I’ve figured out why I was never successful. I didn’t want to quit. It was a comfort to me. I knew it was hurting me, but I wasn’t ready to let it go. 

This time is different. I don’t want this addiction anymore. It no longer brings me comfort. I feel weighed down constantly. My health has been getting worse over the past few years and I am afraid. I can’t keep spending money on something that I know hurts me. I have to quit. I want to quit. I want to finally be free from this.

I’m posting this now to hold myself accountable. Until the 1st, I’m slowly decreasing the amount of nicotine I use, to hopefully help the cravings to not be so intense. I bought a nicotine free vape to help the oral fixation for the first few days. I have a plan and I finally feel ready.

I'll go to the beach, or for a walk, and am so sad that I can't smoke that I'm not enjoying my day to day as much. I used to enjoy smoking and vaping particularly when I'm alone. 

You hear people who give up smoking or vaping say that they always miss it, but I really feel like I've lost an old friend and I'm hoping this feeling diminishes over time.

I'm hoping others can share their stories of how they felt while quitting, if sadness was a side effect for anyone else, and if I can expect this to pass. How long until I don't want to throw a tantrum and cry because I miss nicotine?

I have learned a lot in my 3 days as a non smoker. My triggers are strong when there are some stuff in my life I find emotionally hard to deal with. Its so easy to not face my problems and grap a smoke instead and numb my feelings out. 

The other trigger is when I'm happy. When I do a task or get some good news in my ways i tend to celebrate it with a smoke. I am aware now more than ever that I have some serious work to do regarding behaving my urges.

Luckely i figured out that I don't need to smoke so often, my gravings mostly happens when I go to bed, so that's the area I need to focus on the most. I did feel much more happy these past days, so I can deffenly see a future of me not smokeing some day.

I've had moments where I feel like pulling my hair out and going back to smoking but I also felt that glimmer of happiness because I like to be a non smoker, truth be told I fucking hate smoking it stinks and it's robbing years from my life.

But just wanted to share my progress. I have joined this community today. i have read lot of posts. Im so glad that I could join because i can see lot common problems we ex smokers face and lot of inspiration and encouragement from people who could kill this addiction for good. 

I have smoked for 10 years and most recent  rate of smoking was like two packs for three days. 

Since last year i was on a successful journey of quitting smoking stayed close to 5 months out of smoking 2020 june to December. And picked it up again and on and off couple of times. And stopped on my 32nd birthday 19th of 2021 and going on being a happy non smoker ever since.  Just 29 days. But every quit attempt counts and yeah there will be pangs and cravings but we should become bigger than the addiction. Trying to be conscious about my thoughts which immensely helps me on control acting automatically on usual queues which leads me to go and buy a pack.

somedays it gets rough and really tough, fighting with my own thoughts. But if some how I managed to overcome the temptation to smoke the next day it feels like a victory and make me feels like the next time its gonna be a lot  easier to neglect cravings and continue living happily .

thats all i got to say so for now. Wish everyone have  the courage and mentality to lose the desire to stop smoking which makes this whole process a lot easier. After all we are already non smokers aint we ?cz at this exact moment no body has that filthy stick in our mouths. 
So lets be happy in the moment right now and nothing else matters!

I took a pull off of what could easily have been my 30th cigarette of the day, and somehow I saw how disgusting smoking really is. The smell, my fingers, my breathing, that cough, that grimy feeling. I threw my smoke to the ground where it belonged and said ""fuck this, fuck this shit, fuck off"" and turned my back on it. I made that decision and I stuck to that decision. Not a puff since. 

The difference between this and every other time I tried to quit was a deep seeded feeling of determinatiin, that I was going to be  bigger than the addiction. I was going to be in control of myself and my actions. I didnt tell anyone either, not even my wife. She noticed at some point, but I think I went 3 months before telling anyone else. No added pressure that way.

For any numbers oriented folks, 30 cigarettes a day over 10 years is 109,500 cigarettes not smoked. Thats a fucking lot of cigarettes. Maybe 10+ pulls on each, that a million pulls...

I used to get up at night to pee and I would light a smoke, so if I can do it and keep doing it, it is in all of us, you just have to really want it, enough to put yourself in charge, not the smoke.

I originally wanted to reduce the smoking, be it day by day, or week by week and have loosely been doing that, but it didn't work in the long term. I have also been using a product known as snus, a nicotine pouch placed between the gums and inner lip, that wasn't to reduce my habit of smoking though, I just wanted more of a kick out of nicotine, as I didn't really catch a buzz off cigarettes alone anymore. 

I now only use snus and don't smoke. This is day 1 for me. I still get to feel some nicotine and perpetuate the ritualistic habit the drug entails for me. This is my solution. 

It does however keep me hooked on nicotine. I don't crave snus as much as cigarettes though, so it'll be an easier transition to stopping my use of nicotine altogether. People used to tell me how tough it was to quit. I believe them now. It's tough, but possible. All you need is something to make the transition easier. Be it the occasional smoke or a substitute.

1. Nicotine is addictive

2. My girlfriend smokes too and would like to stop too, but she is not ready to stop. Whenever I see her smoking, I get a strong craving.

3. My life is very stressful with all the things I have to take care of : my family, my studies, my mental health. 

I have managed to reduce a lot in the last few weeks. I don't buy packs anymore, but cigarettes are always available if I ask my girlfriend. She says she wants to be supportive and help me stop, but I can't really count on her with this. I have to do this mostly on my own.

A complete year today. Overall, god damn do I feel better than I did when I was smoking.

I was not a heavy smoker. I started with cigarettes (maybe a pack a week), and then I started vaping. Oh lord did that got me addicted to nicotine. I was smoking 30mg at the beginning which is enormous. At the end, I was at 3mg. Then one day I told myself: after this bottle, i’m over. I did smoke 2-3 cigarettes in the first week of trying to stop, but after that, it was OVER.

First month was very hard. Me and my bf both stopped at the same time. We were literally screaming at each other permanently for absolutely no reason lol. But then, I started to feel less tired and weird when I woke up in the morning. I felt overall less stressed troughout the day (I still do sometimes due to an anxiety disorder) but it has been easier dealing with it.

Now, I hardly even think of smoking anymore. Sometimes i’ll see coworkers or friends do it and for a split second I miss it, but the thought of it passes as quick as it arrived. I never get urges to smoke. It’s always just a brief thought of it, and to be able to say no to it without feeling angry is so rewarding and feels so powerful.

What helped me get through it I would say is just the thought of having a better health, more money in my pockets, and tbh, a big ego lol. Also, i’m still super young (22f) so stopping now was the best thing to do for my future self.

In retrospection, this year has had its ups and downs, but hey, I havent smoked!!!! today i am also celebrating 7 days without alcohol!! If you really want to stop, I believe in you. You are stronger than this nicotine bitch. I hope you all a very good day :).

A good 4 years ago and going all the way back when I was 15 I started smoking, I am 28 now for context but it's been that long since I made some major changes and I'm super glad I did, I just couldn't believe I used to be so cigarette and to top it off I was also drug addicted too! Jeez ! For some reason I was able to say no to meth and stop straight away, my other friends who smoked meth would offer but I would say no, eventually I didn't spend time with them anymore, isolated myself for many years just to self-rehabilitate, I did lose some self esteem and now have a bit of anxiety and PTSD but hey!!! It was all worth it for the peace of mind body and soul I have now, it's going to still be a long journey but I'm super glad. Smoking was my biggest addiction and also negative self doubt is my next, I'm going to kick the fucking shit out of that one too for my next mile stone. Friends...

I’m curious to know this because I quit a little over 4 months ago cold turkey after smoking for 12 years (since 16), it was my first quit ever but the difference between me and some of you is that I didn’t want to quit.

I did it because of a health scare that turned out to be nothing and decided that I might as well just continue quit but i’m 4 months in and having a hard time still, perhaps because I didn’t have a goodbye or the urge to quit didn’t come from me but external circumstances… 

Anyway, this is my question to all people who’ve relapsed, did you feel like yourself again after you relapsed? Did it kill your depression/anxiety? I’ve noticed that people who relapse often stop coming to this sub, it must mean that they went on with their livrs as smokers forgettinf about the mental state of withdrawal misery.

After 4 months I still think I’m forcing myself to stay quit and I’m still unhappy because I don’t get to smoke like I used to (I’m still suffering from some withdrawal anxiety but nothing crippling, anxiety that was non existant back when I used to smoke).",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,128798,public,self,Question for people who relapsed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/q932mc/question_for_people_who_relapsed/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 I kinda fucked up a little - well I‘d say im walking on very thin ice.. 
So basically i quit for months . I had such a great time - no cravings no worries - just perfect &amp; a happy nonsmoker.
3 weeks ago things got shaky. I got wasted with my friends &amp; started yolo smoking drunk af. Next day I was kinda mad but also I had no cravings so i was like .. it wasn’t too bad fuck it. Everything good but the next saturday i went for a beer with my friend &amp; I thought if I drink I allow myself to smoke. As I took a couple sips of my beer I started smoking - but it was disgusting I really didn’t enjoy the cig but it kinda felt like it had to be done. So I finished didnt smoke anymore all good no cravings nothing next week, but last saturday I drank a couple of beers with friends &amp; for somereason I thought, Ill smoke anyways -might aswell buy a pack instead of asking all the time. Well this time I had cravings the other day &amp; the day after &amp; everyday &amp; each day i buy cigs smoke a couple get mad &amp; throw the pack away but inthe morning the cravings are so much stronger than the will to not smoke.. its so sad 😪 I have to get back on track- I was doing so good so long - how could i mess up like this.. again😳 (not the first time i quit ~3months &amp; started again)

I found that for myself, keeping track of the days only kept my kind on cigarettes so I'm treating it like it was mever a part of my life. It's been less than a couple weeks, probably.

I'd quit for 3 months at a time or more, then pick it up again and I've repeated this probably 10 times over the last 10 years. My parent's families are both huge and they had me late and dad's genes aren't the best so everytime I'd quit, someone died. Been to about 12 funerals in that time span and not to mention both my parents smoke like chimneys, but I don't like making excuses and I felt shitty every time I picked it back up. So here's to hoping I don't have to forget how long it's been since my last cigarette again. 

I've never reached out to a forum or platform of any kind so I'm hoping airing it out a little bit will give me a greater sense of responsibility to stay off it. 

Full disclosure I smoke the equivalent of about half a joint of weed a day or less and that significantly helps with withdrawals and insomnia (cessation and non-cessation related)

When i figured out why i smoked i could easilly quit but now even though i sucsessfully quitted for a year now without any feel of quit im right in this weird situtation and i wonder if people did experience the same.

I’m on day 6 (tomorrow is one week) and I’m proud of myself (probs the most ever). I’ve been mostly caffeine free for the years (sweet tea only), I am off and on with weed, I drink a maximum of one soda a day, and now no cigarettes. Super surreal that this day has come.

Here’s the story.. I started in middle school off and on and that continued increasing until hs. Senior year, I quit. Come time to go to bars and clubs, I was back to socially smoking. That eventually spilled over into every day life. Over the years, I’d set dates to quit. Like the back of the shampoo bottle, rinse and repeat. Tons of failures over the years (light failures because was my mind really there/ready to quit?). Then I set a hard date where I had to quit, that passed by which was last year. Then September hit and my brain realized I had just swept it under the rug like nothing and so at that point I made a promise to myself to quit by October 1st, but this time had to be different because I was just not going to buy another pack. Pack after pack the cravings pushed me to give in, but my rule was when you finish a pack you have to wait as long as you can before giving in. The longest I made it was 16 hrs without buying a pack. Last Friday hit, my last cig in the pack was around mid day and I started getting that feeling so I pushed it to the end of the day cig before bed.

The biggest part of it, in my opinion, is being ready. Nobody else can do that for you. For me, I asked myself if I want to smoke a year from now and it’d always be an answer of no, but I never pushed myself to do something about it. The second biggest thing is to talk to someone (in my case it is a friend) who has quit so there’s the relatable portion of knowing what its like.

As of right now, I still take my “smoke breaks” just to get away and let it all go, I still have cravings, I still love cigs, but they’re not for me. I put them into the same place as some of the harder things I used to do,,, they’re not for me.

Things are going well! In the last week I've only thought about smoking a handful of times, and none of them were particularly long or strong cravings. We had a friend over last Saturday who still smokes and it felt odd not to be joining him, but I wasn't feeling particularly tempted to. I sat out with him once just for the company, but the smell really put me off.

My anxiety and agitation are down. I'm having an easier time focusing. Things in general are looking up.

Hubby smoked half a cig a couple days ago at work after 11 days without. He said it made him feel like trash afterwards, headachy and nauseated. We talked about how the addiction lied to him. It told him ""your break will feel better with me"" and made him feel sick instead, which increased his stress the rest of the day instead of relieving it. I'm proud of him for keeping going.

I'm 41. For the last 12 months or so I was smoking one or two ciggies a day + having a bunch of ciggies when I was out partying which was once every couple of months (lockdown!)

I'd been more-or-less off cigarettes for a year before then, but I'd smoke when I was at the pub etc. 

I was a heavy smoker from 20 to 30 years old, but most of my 30's I'd cut back to 3 or 4 a day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had a cigarette for about a month now. I can feel my body repairing itself and there's a lot of mucus etc. and I occasionally feel a little sore in (one side) of my chest. I've seen a doctor and had my blood pressure checked, done a blood test, had an ECG etc. and there's nothing to report there. 

I'm guessing what I'm feeling will pass, and I've read it can take up to 5 months for your lungs to start functioning normally. 

Just wondering if anyone whose been off the cigarettes had these sort of symptoms?

I hadn’t planned it, I woke up at 3 in the morning (not unusual for a smoker), breathing was terrible, and just thought I had to do this sometime…. maybe I could do it today.

I’m 45.  I’ve  smoked for 30 years… mostly 20 a day but probably 25 the past couple of years. It hasn’t done me any favours with my skin, hair, breathing, fitness, savings.  This is probably my 4th serious quit… I’ve managed 3, 9 and 12 months before.   I hope this is the one.

Im waffling on… the reason I’m posting is to give some reassurance to those a few weeks behind my journey.

Week 3 was particularly hard until I realized it was week 3 and just needed to get through it. Week 5 was a nightmare because I thought week 3 was supposed to be the worst!

But now, all of a sudden, it’s so so much easier.  I can focus on the positives of not smoking rather than constantly mourn the loss. Theres still a couple of times a day when I’d love a smoke, and I think about them often… that probably sounds scary but it’s not that bad at all… it’s not in that all consuming way of the first 5 weeks. It’s such a relief.  It does get better. It does get easier. I’m so pleased with myself when I remember that I forgot to think about smoking.

My husband is a very dedicated smoker so there’s always tobacco in the house… but that’s ok.  The trick is to remember that in x amount of months, when I think I can just have one, I can’t.  I hope this time sticks.

I've had almost none physical withdrawal symptoms and a few stronger-than-average cravings that I ofc acknowledged but didn't have to really struggle or anything. All the nicotine should've left my body by now, so it seems the physical addiction should be easing up. 

My question, I guess, is this: can it really be this easy? Or is the worst part still somehow coming..? 😂 How to prepare myself for the future? I would've expected the 1st week to be the worst both mentally and physically, and then gradually easing up. My quit has been so easy from the start that it feels surreal to be going back to smoking.

And yet, the majority of posts that I'm reading here or on FB groups are by people who have quit numerous times. This is also backed up by the statistics. In these posts people have stayed quit for 6 months, a year, or 3 years... before picking up smoking again. And then quitting again.

No longer ‘panic’ if I’ve run out of cigs nor stress if I’m running low (cos I don’t smoke). That really is incredible freedom and eventually becomes a norm without considering the previous burden. 

I no longer need to leave situations to get a fix and so I don’t interrupt our family activities which feels  wonderful. I still catch myself thinking I would have left and missed this or that. 

I don’t stink of smoke. With kids and a partner who doesn’t smoke this is a huge deal for us. 

Don’t really have any strong cravings or maybe even cravings, just perhaps fond memories at times which are followed by ‘it’s never gonna happen’ and ‘remember the shit that comes with that’

money saved but money spent :)

It wasn’t easy but after the initial weeks it settles down and becomes normalised so I hope this gives people hope who are nearer this stage than 3-5 years. [although the 3-5 year people give me hope :) ]

My boyfriend is very secretive about his smoking history because I had cancer before and he never smoked when I met him so when I asked he would just tell me it didn't matter. I know he was being honest about not smoking anymore because he's never lied to me in our relationship. I've asked him things from 6 months ago and he'll give the exact same, truthful answer. My point is that he was genuinely quit. He quit when he started dating his ex girlfriend and then smoked again for a while before quitting and then meeting me. 

This Thanksgiving we were going to his family's dinner and I was very stressed out and anxious, so I smoked a cigarette from a pack that I've had for over a year, that is more full than empty. He went outside with me and looked like a sad puppy dog, and asked me if he could have one puff off of it. I told him no initially but he promised that he just wanted to see if he even like it anymore. Well what do you know an addict trying an addictive substance would get him addicted again. Later when we got back to his home I wanted to smoke my medical Marijuana so he came out with me again and asked if he could have a cigarette. After I went home yesterday he went out and bought a pack. I'm so upset with myself, not with him. I gave him the puff and should have known better.

Does anyone know where I can go from here? I've never seen him be so happy and in such a good mood. I'm afraid now that he knows I won't be upset with him he will never stop. He doesn't seem like he ever wanted to quit in the past and only did it to convenience others. I'm not going to break up over it, this is my mess to clean up. I know I'm an awful girlfriend and I'm sorry to him and everyone here.

I was recently talking to someone about quitting smoking and decided to pop back on here to check my number to see how long it has actually been since I quit.  It's been over 4 years!

To anyone quitting now, I am proof that it is possible for anyone!

I quit at age 34 after trying to quit unsuccessfully for about a decade.  Remember that every time you try to quit, whether you succeed or not that attempt, you are closer to quitting.  I do believe that. 

I first quit at age 32 by reading Allen Carr's book ""Easy Way to Quit Smoking"".  

I had heard that if you read this book, you would quit immediately and not suffer through withdrawal.  It sounded like utter bullshit to me!  But, you were allowed smoke while reading it, so I figured I'd try it to prove what bullshit it was. 

I read the book.  It wasn't magic or anything.  It just goes bit by bit and convinces you that you don't need to smoke, and that you are just a drug addict stuck in the ""nicotine trap"".  I smoked the whole time I read it.  I finished it and went to bed.  I woke up the next day and didn't want to smoke. 

I quit for about 8 months.  Then I went to a party where everyone was smoking.  It had been so long and smoking looked so fun, I figured one cigarette wouldn't kill me.  Well, down the slippery slope I went.  Next time with friends, I bummed more cigarettes.  Soon, I was buying packs just for when I was going to be drinking.  Pretty soon after that, I was smoking again. 

Carr's book said that once you quit, all it will take is 1 cigarette to get you going again, and he was absolutely right!  I smoked for another year or so, absolutely furious with myself.  Finally, I decided that enough was enough and I was going to try to quit again.  I remembered everything I had read in the book, and was able to quit cold turkey and never smoke again!

I haven't had a cigarette in over 4 years, and I haven't missed it at all!  I am so thankful and happy that I do not have to smoke anymore.  I will be at parties and events now and try to mindfully think about how much I would have missed before because I was constantly running outside to smoke.  I take deep breaths and enjoy my clear lungs.  I look at the price of cigarettes at convenience stores and smile that I'm not shelling out thousands of dollars on it anymore.  

Not sure if this wall of text will be helpful to anyone, but I hope so.  If anyone is thinking of quitting, I'd recommend the book.  If anyone has already started, keep it up!

She smokes almost a pack every day.  She will spend 30 minutes smoking two or three at a time.   I quit about a year ago and have not touched one since.   Actually, I successfully quit 4 times, each for at least a few months.   I guess that doesn't really mean I was successful.   But living with a chain smoker is not easy.  She keeps promising to quit but doesn't even try.  She ""cuts back"" to quit but that only lasts a day or two

She just got back from a trip with her family.  They do not smoke and they do not know she does.  She keeps it a secret from them.  The trip lasted 10 days.  She promised that she would be done for good.  The very first thing she did as soon as she got back was buy a pack.  And honestly, I knew that's exactly what she was going to do

Apparently her aunt was a little mean to her on the trip.  So according to my wife her aunt is to blame.  And now once again she says the stress from work and dealing with Crohn's disease keep keep her smoking.  She also blames me because she says I can stress her out  

Honestly, this might be a deal breaker for me.  We cannot afford her addiction.  I tell her this often.  But it doesn't change a thing. I'm worried about her long term health which could very well bankrupt us when she needs to be hospitalized or develops severe illnesses.  

I don't want her to resent me.  I don't want to upset her.  I don't want to give her an ultimatum.  Those will only make her habit worse

I asked her to seek help from doctors, counselor, or anything  that will help her quit.  Nope.  Not going to happen 

I don't know what to do.  At this point I don't believe she will ever quit.  Most of her friends smoke and she hangs out with them a few times every week

I have been lurking this sub for a while now. Been a constant, chronic smoker for two years and wanted to quit as of recently. I told myself I would try self-control and go cold turkey but it hadn’t lasted for more than a few hours. I also do not want to do NRT because I really want the drug out of my system. I downloaded QuitSure and am starting day 3 tomorrow, but haven’t reduced my smoking since the app had suggested not to. 

I guess I am aware of what I need to do for myself but I find that it’s completely different from actually doing it. I feel more anxious/sad now that I see the habit for what it is — a drug addiction — and there’ll be a lot of times where I’ll start to believe those hopeless thoughts and feelings. I only have less than half a pack left and I really hate how conflicted my mind feels on whether or not I should buy “one last one”.

I wanted to go cold Turkey but I knew it was going to be rough so I bought the step 3 nicoderm patch with the lowest dose of 7mg and figured this will help with the symptoms. It was definitely a lower dose than what my body was used to because I am still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms.

Day 1 - the urge to smoke was really strong, I really wanted a cigarette in the evening but I stuck my patch on and got through it. Definitely felt some restlessness at night.

Day 2 - today I began to feel slight flu-like symptoms like head pressure and body aches, twisting stomach sensation. But the urge to smoke wasn’t as bad. Feeing like crap makes me not want to smoke more. The anxiety is pretty high today too, I feel like I want to go running 5 miles just to help relieve the anxiousness

I've quit nicotine quite a few times on my journey, 2 years has been my best attempt (so far). I've learned from my attempts that it's easier when I avoid other triggers, addictions, habits to gain ""willpower"". I spent the last month quitting weed and caffeine, and the past few weeks I've been going hard with yoga, exercise, breath-work and meditation to ""feel like a new person and disturb my habitual ruts"". 

I know I can do this without fasting, but I'm wondering if that has helped anyone? I could see it adding a bunch of extra stress on top of withdraws, but maybe it would be more beneficial in ways like speeding up withdraw recovery? I couldn't find any scientific literature on the subject (with nicotine anyways) but personally, once I water fast for 3/4 days I begin to feel amazing. The first 3 days of both fasting and nicotine withdraw are probably some of the hardest times I've put myself thru, but today I'm beginning both as sort of an experiment to test my willpower and to see if helps. 

I'm in my last semester to become a Dietitian, so I know quite a bit about diet, fasting and overall health. I have completed a lot of 3+ day water fasts so it's nothing new to me.

Chew wasn't my main source of nicotine. Something about the Wintergreen flavor that I really miss. Maybe I'll get some Wintergreen gum today. 

Stay strong guys! You're all awesome! We can do this together!

I'd love to hear how any of you have handled cravings. Smoking/chewing/vaping. Anything that was tempting and how you held off.

For me, it's the time. I'm so close to 9 years. Not sure how I'm going to celebrate, but it'll be something. I just can't give up. And I've quit. There's no going back.

I need an answer for the question in the end of this text please!

I am 19 and have been smoking for 8 months, you will think that it's not that long of a period but trust me it has affected me mentally and physically so much that i hate myself now.
I wasn't a heavy smoker, i would smoke between 3 and 6 a day and there were some days when i don't smoke at all and here are the reasons:

1- i feel that i got uglier, my pupils got smaller and i have dark circles under my eyes.. my hair got thinner. When i see photos before starting to smoke it kills me, i want to cry.
2- it made my social life harder, and it made my relation with my parents so complicated when it was perfect.
3- I can hardly enjoy anything in life which sucks af.


I am ready to stop smoking today and start to exercise and my question is will my apparearance get better? Will my hair and my face go back normal again??

On the plus side that was the longest I've ever managed and I'm determined I'm not going to revert back to my former identity as a smoker now. 

Severe loneliness and burnout and low mood definitely contributed to cracking. I'm isolated and my ADHD and depression has been kicking my arse lately along with coping with other life stressors...but I think the main cause of caving was the fact that occasional vaping as part of nicotine reduction had crept up as a smoking substitute and I realised that the last few days I was actually consuming way more nicotine than as a smoker but without the unpleasant side effects of smoking and was therefore just swapping an identity as a smoker for one as a vaper when I had started out so strong with NRT. I know a lot of folks here equate vaping with smoking but personally the main thing I needed to mentally overcome was the habit of smoking and the ability to deceive myself that I need to be a smoker. But more importantly to learn to value myself as worth more than poisoning myself with these horrid things.

I've had a seriously low week with depression and haven't been able to eat or sleep well at all. I woke up early this morning and meditated and stretched and spent time with these feelings instead of avoiding them or beating myself up. I'm going to get through today with smokes and tonight the juul and the smokes are going in the bin. Plan is to pick up where I left off tomorrow morning after a good night's sleep but with nicotine patches and by consciously cultivating the mindset I had 41 days ago. I had grown complacent in the quitting process. 

Every cigarette I light smells and tastes absolutely foul and disgusting and makes me feel like a junkie. I can't believe the insane exhaustion and brain fog the oxygen deprivation is causing me and yet I'm sitting here thinking that I can solve the fuzziness with another cigarette.

I have also tried quitting MANY TIMES, going cold turkey before picking up another cig mere hours later. It was a brutal, endless cycle that seems to not helping. Best is 99 days 4 years ago and it was ruined by just ONE puff, which i thought was harmless. I also vape heavily. Low nicotine juice dont work for me, 50mg juices are my favourite and although i try using it as alternatives to cigaratte, it was not helping either. I will vape in the car and the moment i stepped outside, i will smoke 2 cigaratte. I felt vaping made my smoking habit worst. Also i believe, cold turkey doesnt work for me.

Eventually sometime in July last year, i decided to quit again. Not immediately but to do it on the day after my birthday, which was 3 months later back then. Since, i enjoy smoking more. Every cigarette i smoke, i enjoyed it. I appreciated every drag. As the date came closer for me to ‘quit’, i realised smoking is not at all fun. It was a waste of time and money. I wouldnt believe it when i was a smoker but smoking WASTE YOUR TIME. Alot of time! I started to feel excited to quit. 

And on my birthday last year, the day i supposed to quit, i bought 3 packs of cigs. These are my last, so i bought menthol, normal and clove cigarattes. I sat in one bench and smoke away, reminiscing the time about the day i first started to smoke. I smoke 2,3,4 cigarette at a time. Every cig make me sick and i dont actually feel anything. It was not really enjoyable as i have thought. 

Night time comes and i know i should not smoke the next morning. Threw all my cig away except one stick (for emergency) I went to bed and slept the night. Next morning, i had a few urges and threw the last stick away and reminded myself that i am now a non smoker and keep doing that and get myself the mindset that smokers are a disgust and bunch of losers because they cant quit but i can do it and lo and behold, it has been one year now and i have zero craving for cigarette!

&amp;#x200B;

Dear quitters of Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who quit smoking four years ago today, I want to share my insight and personal experience on what worked for me. I am in no way a professional or a counselor or qualified to give advice, I am just a person who has smoked for twelve years and decided on a Tuesday afternoon in October of 2017 that it was enough. I haven't relapsed once and these days I don't even think about it anymore. Except of course today, because a reminder popped up an told me ""Four years smoke free today"".

&amp;#x200B;

The idea of quitting had been in my mind for a while. Not because my partner wanted me to quit, or because I thought cigarettes were getting too expensive. Not even because I worried that I could develop some nasty health issues when I got older.

&amp;#x200B;

I quit because I wanted to be free of my addiction. And, more specifically: I wanted to be able to sit through an entire movie on Netflix without having to pause for a smoke.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Before**

I would always worry if I had enough cigarettes with me. If the shops were still open. If I could smoke at place X. I used to think in smoke breaks, as I'm sure many of you can relate to. Five minutes before a meeting? Time for a cigarette. Commercials on tv? Smoke time. A short walk to a bus stop? Smoke time. I didn't want to admit it, but smoking cigarettes dominated my entire schedule. It did so sneakily, but it did so nonetheless. If I spent two hours or more in a museum, I wanted to get outside and smoke. I didn't necessarily want to leave, but my addiction was demanding my attention. I couldn't concentrate on the beautiful art before me, I was only thinking ""when can I smoke?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**During withdrawal**

Did you know that people who quit smoking are often fighting more than one fight? Of course you do. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. You fight the withdrawal symptoms.

2. You fight the desire to smoke. 

3. For some, fighting against overeating as a substitute.

4. You struggle as your brain re-adjusts itself to a life without cigarettes (the habitual part, the part where you don't know what to do with your hands).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a big difference between wanting to quit and being told to quit (either by a person or a situation): I wanted to quit, so I didn't have to fight the desire to smoke. I knew for a fact that I never wanted to light up a cigarette ever again. A switch had flipped in my brain as clearly as if a light turned on in a room.

Now, that did not make the withdrawal symptoms any less bad. The nicotine receptors in my brain were as loud as they always were. The thing that made it easier is that I was able to look beyond the initial withdrawal and focus on the ""after"". Withdrawal doesn't last forever. it's a very real, chemical process in your brain. The nicotine receptors shrink after a while and you won't crave cigarettes anymore. After that, there is a calmer, clearer mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of thinking ""I can't smoke anymore"", I thought ""I've quit smoking. I am experiencing these withdrawal symptoms. I feel like sh\*t but I know this won't last forever. After this is over, I will be free.""

&amp;#x200B;

I would write it down whenever I was wide awake at 3AM, restless, irritated, antsy, grinding my teeth and unable to stay still. In fact, I wrote a lot in the deep dark hours of the night, mostly just describing my feelings or record the time as it passed by. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**After**

First and foremost: I am not a saint. Quitting smoking didn't miraculously heal all my problems and there are many things I struggle with (I got 99 problems but a smoke ain't one). I am not the person who is going to tell you that you will feel amazing and fantastic and reborn. No - you will feel... normal. I feel normal. And it's the best kind of normal I can imagine, because smoking made me feel like a pariah. I can exit any building I have been in for however many minutes and not reach for my cigarettes the moment I walk out. I can make my coffee in the morning and snuggle up on the couch while looking at the downpour and not stand in it, shivering, with coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I don't count in cigarettes anymore. A meeting is now not in one cigarette, but in five minutes. I am no longer constantly thinking about it, being inconvenienced by it, distracted by it, controlled by it. I can spend hours in a museum and be amazed and fully focused on the beauty I see. I can go to the cinema and stay in my seat during the break. I feel normal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**In conclusion**

I encourage everyone to go and feel super normal. I know everyone's situation is different and I am not here to tell you one method is wrong and the other is right. I just want to shine some light on your motivation to quit smoking. Because if the motivation comes from within you, if you are the one who decides, you can do it. The fight won't be as difficult. And it will 100% be worth it to just not have to think about those stupid cigarettes anymore.

For me, I chose a time in my life where I felt I wasn't under high stress and things were going relatively well.

Smoking makes no sense at all

It is unhelathy, it is expensive, it makes you stink. Why would anyone want to smoke, at all?

2. It is stressful

When you're a smoker, you always have to worry about having a lighter, lighting up, cigarette butts, ash, emptying ashtrays, buying a pack, having a pack, opening windows during winter when your room stinks, and it's all really - a lot. Once you quit it's all gone.

3. No smoking lifestyle - is a healthy lifestyle

Once you quit smoking, you start to take care of  your body as well. You develop a healthy mindset. For example, I started to take a lot more vitamins than I used to, and drink a lot more teas. You simply choose what's good for you.

4. It's an achievement

If you're a smoker who quit smoking, you feel proud of yourself. Like, I really did that? I managed to quit an addiction? And you just feel better about yourself. It's an huge ego boost, and you start to see yourself as someone who is capable of anything.

5. You're calmer

I'm going to give an account of my journey from smoking, to changing over to vaping, to quitting fully now, just to say thanks for helping me quit smoking more than anything else ever did, and probably saving my life in the process. Hopefully this can give inspiration to others that want to quit and will give ideas on the methods I used that may work for someone else.

I'll start when I was 18, in 2009/2010 and started smoking. My first pack was Marlboro menthol 100s. the funny feeling of getting dizzy from smoking and thinking it was kind of cool continued for a bit until I was fully addicted and couldn't stop, nor did I really want to. I remember thinking after a few years that I wish I had never started, as the person that got me into smoking had quit, most of my friends that smoked had quit or at least only smoked when partying, etc. and here I was smoking all time and couldn't stop. Well at least I never bought cartons right? That was the point that would mean I was smoking too much, at least that's what I rationalized in my head.

For years this went on, switching from Marlboro Menthols, to Camel Filters, to Camel Crush, to Camel Crush Bold, then when they were banned I went to Camel Menthols. At this point it had been 7 years since I started smoking. I had quit about 4 or 5 years into smoking for about 4 months but I said to myself one day that i could just have a couple when drinking, which progressed right back to full on smoking habit. I was kicking myself because it was so miserable to quit cold turkey like i had and now I'd have to go through it again if i was going to quit again, which I thought I might never. I had started buying cartons maybe a year or 2 before the seven year mark, something i never wanted to do. Every paycheck I would buy a carton plus 4 packs, as I was smoking close to a pack a day. I had tried vaping before this point, with the little pen vapes that weren't very good or didn't last very long on battery. I could never figure out how to get the lung hit that I needed and got whenever smoking a cigarette, so I never stuck with the vaping. If i was just going to feel like i was breathing flavored air then what was the point? Like I said this was towards the beginning of when vaping was becoming a thing, I tried to be one of the earliest adopters but it didn't work for me.

At around 7 years I was starting to wake up and not be able to take full breaths until like 5 or 10 minutes after waking up. My lungs were hurting every morning and I knew my smoking days had to come to an end as this was definitely not good. It legitimately scared me feeling like that every couple mornings for about 6 months. That's when a coworker at the time, who i would smoke with on smoke breaks, got big into vaping. I mean, went off the deep end on all the tech, different tanks and atomizers, making his own coils, all that kind of stuff. This was also right at the beginning of box mods becoming popular, so that was a plus for me, since the pen batteries only had maybe a 5 hour battery life for me and wouldn't get me all the way through work. He started showing me a bunch of this stuff and I headed to a vape shop with him to see all the different things i could try after trying his tank and box mod setup, that made a lot more vapor than the pens too.

In the end I ended up picking up a Sigelei 100w box mod [https://imgur.com/a/vAwFKeo](https://imgur.com/a/vAwFKeo) and a Kanger subtank [https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL](https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL) . I was originally using 18 or 12 mg nicotine juice and paid attention while smoking cigs to see what it felt like with air flow, lung hit feel, etc. I found that cutting the airflow almost completely off, to where it felt like i was dragging on a cig, and having the high nicotine content and a dual coil at 60w to give the harsh lung hit, was exactly what I was looking for. I was smoking and vaping for months, still holding onto the cigs, until I noticed one day that I was picking the vape over the cigs more and more often because it tasted better, and specifically remember being at work on a smoke break and smoking a quarter of a cig and throwing it out. I thought at that point ""why are you still smoking these things, you're throwing most of it away, it is a waste of money now."" That is when I went on to vape completely. I believe this was 2016. 

The years go by, still only vaping, still using 12mg as 18 was kind of phased out of use in the whole industry it seemed, and was satisfied. Whenever i had a cig at a party or something every 6 months or so, it would taste terrible, and I'd toss it after only a few puffs. I had the Sigelei 150w temperature control [https://imgur.com/a/Be7b8cq](https://imgur.com/a/Be7b8cq) by then, still the same Kanger tank [https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL](https://imgur.com/a/h07KJwL) with the dual coils, not using the temperature function at all, just the same 60w as usual. I remember other vapers commenting they couldn't believe i still had that setup still, like it was an antique or something haha! 

Well around the end 2019 I believe, I could not find coils for the tank anymore and the box mod was pretty beat up too, so I went to the local bigger vape shop and asked about what was good nowadays as I never took it on as a hobby and had no idea what kind of tech was out there now for box mods and tanks. The guy behind the counter was using a Voopoo Drag 2 [https://imgur.com/a/8Qp8xzZ](https://imgur.com/a/8Qp8xzZ) and a Freemax Mesh Pro tank [https://imgur.com/a/xg06AuG](https://imgur.com/a/xg06AuG) . I bought those for my new setup and was happy with it. The mesh helped get an instant hit like if you were hitting a cig, plus setting it up the same way with the airflow almost closed off got that cig feel and i was good to go. I was a little worried i'd lose that feel with a new setup and go back to smoking.

So now we get to the end of 2020. Keep in mind that I had been ordering my coils and juice online for years from giantvapes and hadn't had to deal with the hassle of going to a store for anything other than that new setup. Here comes Trump's dumbass vape mail ban, I couldn't believe it. I bought what I could until I couldn't order anymore and hoped to see how that would hold me, but I knew the end of vaping was coming for me. I wasn't going to pay double the price for stuff in a physical store. That ended up not being the case but i was sure it would be that way, as it used to be 23$ for a 30ml bottle back in the day from a store, and half that online (This shows you how long it had been since i had gone into a physical store lol).

I finished my last bit of 12mg after a couple months and decided to try to start to ween myself off nicotine if i could. This never worked before with cigs and I always had the experience of not getting the lung hit with lesser nicotine juice, but i thought i would try it. So I dropped to 6mg, and i was shocked to find it still had a lung hit. Maybe not as hard but I was used to it after a few days and I was good to go. After I ran out of 6mg a couple months later, I dropped to 3mg for a couple months, with the same effect, got used to the hit after a couple days and it was fine. This whole time I had not craved for more nicotine, nor was I vaping any more than I used to, which was a pleasant surprise, even though I pretty much vaped constantly anyways.

Now we get to about 2 months ago. I was taking the last big step and buying 0mg nicotine juice after not being without nicotine for about 12 years. I guess because i had stepped down to 3mg and was still able to vape to satisfy the habit/mental part of it, i had nearly NO WITHDRAWALS! It was amazing, the only affect i had was a little irritation and foggy headedness the first day but after that it was like nothing happened, I didn't crave it because I was still vaping, so it was nothing like when i quit cold turkey. The only issue was that now, with 0mg nicotine, it really did feel like there was no lung hit anymore, like i was just breathing flavored air again, and I worried about going back to the nicotine juice again and getting dependent on nicotine again. I just puffed harder to get what little lung hit 0mg has and I kicked the nicotine.

Now we're to about a week ago, and not getting the lung hit is starting to annoy me. I had the realization that I'm not enjoying this anymore as I'm expecting to get that lung hit and getting disappointed every time I vape, once again the ""flavored air, what's the point"" thing. So I said screw it and dropped it all together. I have taken a couple puffs since a week ago but that is it, I've pretty much quit altogether. 

I never thought I would quit vaping, as it is safe and I enjoy the act of smoking so why would I quit? Well the mail ban and not wanting to be addicted to something anymore has finally made it a pain in the ass enough where i'm done with it. No more sneaking puffs indoors somewhere because it's not allowed there. No more going outside in the rain or freezing cold or sweltering heat at work to get puffs because i NEED it. No more making a nasty film on the inside of the glass in my car because the vape condenses on them and it's a bitch to clean off. No more dreading flying on a plane because from the time you get into the airport until the time you're out of your destination airport, there's basically nowhere to vape/smoke and I vaped/smoked like a chimney. And no more coughing in the morning, even though vaping is safe it would still condense on the inside of my lungs and make me cough some in the morning and throughout the day.

My entire adult life I've needed nicotine to make it by, always having to plan ahead to make sure I had enough cigs or juice to make it through to when i could buy more, or being broke in my early adult years and spending money on cigs rather than food because I couldn't be without it. I keep looking over to grab my vape and walk outside out of habit, then I remember I dont need that anymore, it's not even with me. I have literally stood up at work, and paced around the office, thinking it felt weird that I hadn't gone outside for a vape yet. It's like it's all totally new for me, I haven't not done these things since I was in high school, and it feels great!

Anyways, the point to all this is just to share with people that understand what I went through, as most of us have to some degree had a similar story I think and to share a story that may help more of you make that transition from smoking to vaping, using the way i set up the vape to make it feel like a cigarette, or from vaping to fully quitting if you choose. I was on 12mg nicotine for god's sake, most vapers couldn't even hit my vape because it would give them coughing fits from how strong it was. If I can do it you definitely can, cliche I know, but try it out the way I did and it may work for you. Those of you that are continuing to vape, no shade thrown towards you either. If it wasn't banned from getting supplies mailed to me, I'd probably still be vaping, and I definitely loved having a way to ""smoke"" without risking cancer, stinking of cig smoke, etc. I'm thankful that vaping got me off cigs which I don't think I could've done myself, and it pisses me off to no end that it is demonized when it has saved so many lives, myself included. It didn't matter that I saw my great uncle without a nose because he had to have it removed because of smoking. It didn't matter seeing those commercials with the guy with the hole in his throat, or any of that stuff. Vaping was finally the thing that worked, and after all these years I can say I'm free, to join the people I started smoking with all those years ago that quit as well. 

Thanks for all the help over the years on this subreddit and encouragement, I wish you all the best, and with any luck, this will by my last goodbye to this sub. Be excellent to each other!

We have supposedly already seen every single video possible yet I find one labeled name and name. So I think cool that'll be funny and pop it on.

Fast forward through cringy ass singing at age 12 we stumble upon unseen footage of life how it used to be, I was 13 smoking, swearing and trying to live up to the people around me.

I was sat at the kitchen dining table holding a role up in each hand and smoking both.

It was at this point I realised as an adult (28) that I was disgusted with myself, I was a child back then and I should of had better parental care but I know my mum had just came out of a really bad domestic violence relationship so I kinda don't blame her for being so withdrawn, I mean I don't know personally what that is like to be beat up for years.

I have two kids and I've stopped smoking various times, of course whilst pregnant, months after having my kids I'd pick the habit up whilst stressed, then I quit again and the cycle would continue.

I watched that video as a parent and thought to myself I'd that was my kid this would NOT be happening!

So it's now 4.08am when I wake up a little later I'm banging a patch on and going for it, that home video has been the ultimate wake up call for me because of the different levels of disgust I feel.

About a week ago, there has been much less hair in the drain.  This morning, I noticed practically none.  I was perplexed.  I'm still taking the medication.  Why the sudden turnaround?  What am I doing differently?

There is good news too: I am AWARE of all of this. I am observing the craziness that addiction can cause and I am not reacting to anything (except that I breathe, heavily, between cravings).

I hope you're all doing well. Today marks the 6th day without smoking cigarettes for me. This is the longest I've been in over 1 year and 10 months! I'm 22y old and university student.

This is going to be a long post and I'm sorry in advance.

I'd been a smoker for 2 years but with a ''vacation off cigarettes'' for couple of months where I would smoke one or two here and there but that was it. Throughout my smoking ''career'' I was increasing how much I smoke during the day throughout those 2 years. In the end I would smoke 1 pack and sometimes even 1 and a half or maybe 2 when I was stressed. I realize that 2 years may seem like nothing but believe me, I was a smoker like anyone else with a longer cigarette smoking history behind. My day was built around cancer sticks, they were the first thing for me in the morning and the last thing before going to bed. I would go freezing myself on the balcony in the winter to smoke and I would go in the middle of the night to buy a pack on the machine because tobacco shops didn't work at 12am. This was all just a sign that I was ADDICTED TO A DRUG. Being addicted isn't fun at all. Problem is that some smokers don't even want to accept the fact that they are addicted, they think they like smoking, but that's just a trick their brain is playing on them.

I quit with the help of 25mg Nicorette patch.Without it I would have never quit. I just don't have that strong of a willpower to quit without NRT. I've tired gum and lozenges but I threw up because of the taste and how much I just didn't like them so I decided to get the patches.

The biggest thing I noticed is how much more free time I have now. I can finally dedicate myself to playing video games that I really love and not playing for 1 hour and then craving for a cigarette. I can drink coffee and actually spend time with it, talking to persons around me and not craving for anything. I'll buy a book to read in my free time as well and I'll study more to finish the last couple of exams I have left to graduate.

My biggest motivators to quit were my financial situation, I truly believe that every person should be a better human being to himself/herself and to his family and people who he or she loves. I didn't want my mom and gran to spend money to buy me cigarettes and not have enough for other things... I also wanted to do things I love like gaming and reading and watching things without constantly being bothered for a smoke. I also didn't want to be anxious when I don't have enough cigarettes for the day. And many other things.

I plan to gradually reduce the strenght of the patches within the next few weeks and finally get off them as well. I always take them off before going to sleep and I don't have any issues. During the first few days with the patches I noticed that my skin where the patch is would itch but that would pass within few minutes so not that big of a deal.

I encourage all to quit, using any method you may need or you may find suitable. My psychatrist told me not to quit cold turkey so I didn't and I couldn't have done it that way.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my story and hold myself accountable. 

P.S. I still think about smoking and romanticize it but I hope I don't cave in.

I’ve tried quitting 10+ times : cold turkey, vaping, patches and nicotine candies. The longest I went without smoking were 4 and 7 months, using a vape.

I’m currently 8 months pregnant, down to 6 to 10 cigarettes a day and desperate about ever quitting. I’m in a very poor mental state due to the guilt and worry of smoking while pregnant, and perpetual anxiety because of the stigma, even though you’d guess I’m trying to hide it.

I’ve been actively trying to stop since I got pregnant but with no success. I couldn’t get past 24h so far. I’ve seen a midwife that specializes in addiction and got prescribed patches and candies, but they’re the lowest possible dosage and don’t really bring down the urges beside a psychological effect. I hate the candies too and will switch to gums on my next try.

At this point I kind of gave up on the pregnancy motivator since I’ve been smoking for the past full 7 months... but I can’t stomach that I’ll still be smoking when my baby is born. This is disheartening to me. I don’t give up on trying, but I need to plan my next attempt so that I’m not immediately overwhelmed by the cravings.

I can manage to avoid the cigarettes that I usually smoke “throughout the day”, but some are so deeply rooted in my habits and routines that I’ve the hardest time to fight back. The first cigarette of the morning, that I have with  coffee after breakfast, is a big one. Then the one after lunch. Then the one after dinner.

Then I get the worst cravings in the evening, and especially after I’ve put my son to bed and I’m able to lay back and relax. My husband is a heavy smoker too, and this is usually a time when we sit in the garden and chat and smoke. I easily smoke half a day worth of cigarettes there in one sitting, over a couple hours before going to bed. The association between that moment and smoking is so strong I don’t know how to fight it.

Hopes that it will help a fellow ex smoker make sense of their nicotine withdrawal symptom's or help a smoker understand what they could expect after quitting.

 Today I am 28 days smoke free and still going strong!

First 3 days were pretty tough, I had mild tremors and double vision accompanied by somewhat bearable headaches that would come and go throughout the day. Of course agitation was high on the list with my anxiety also being particularly problematic. This was soon followed by excessive mucus down the nasal passage which I did my best to spit out when I was able to but when I wasn't able to, it contributed to congestion and inflammation in the chest, which ultimately felt similar to a chest cold. For that I bought an over the counter bronchodilator syrup which was a great relief and helped get rid of the congestion pretty quickly. A big bowl of chicken soup also helps heaps.

By the end of my first week, I started bloating quite a bit and experienced gastro symptoms, passing larger and more frequent stools. This lasted for the following two weeks and I did make a point of not falling prey to eating more. To help with the stomach issues I started eating cleaner, more veg and probiotics which seemed to settle the stomach issues and the bloating subsided completely after two weeks. 

The purpose of this post is to help others who are either wanting to quit smoking to understand what they COULD experience or those who have recently quit make sense of their symptoms/side effects. We won't all experience the same symptoms/side effects but I think it is worth a shot to share our post quitting experiences because the internet is not always a great help.

Yeah, I know. Tough title but It's true though (I can't believe I found the courage to write these words!): I am gradually turning into a chain smoker. I started to smoke when I was 14-15 years old (currently 29m) and it came a point that I smoked, regularly, 35-40 cigarettes' a day. Yesterday I made the BIG decision: Enough is enough.

In the last 5-6 years I have made a lot of tough decisions and changes (for the better) and I really am a different person: Very confident relatively successful and clear on what I want in life (after many years of suffering from severe anxiety and low self-esteem). Now, It's time for another important step: Letting go of smoking and start focusing on a brighter and healthier future. 

I have already made a mini-plan on how to cope with cravings and how to motivate myself during the tough moments: This community, is part of it! 

I am planning to share my journey with you &amp; hopefully we could all help each other become the best version of ourselves! Thank you so much for reading. Let's do it :)

The issue is my spouse. He's a pack and a half a day smoker and couldn't be the least bit supportive. In fact, at the last slip up, his best friend reprimanded me for giving in while my husband laughed and handed me another. 

My husband has no desire to ever quit; he works in construction and claims it would be too hard. 

But even when I beg him not to go smoke after his nightly shower, he does anyway. 

Then I don't even want to kiss him because he reeks.

I feel like my body is well adjusted now, and yet- I do also have some pretty intense stressors in my life. I also love to consume media in the form of movies - and there is A LOT OF SMOKING shown in these films/shows. So after not having any cravings for the first two-three weeks, now I'm kinda seeing them resurface. I also have work + family (general life) stress.... and I'm just still hanging on for dear life, you know? I guess I'm surprised to find that the cravings can still surface after this length of time, because after the hypnotherapy I felt so solid in my decision. I even somewhat became nauseous at the thought of it..... which like - yes it is nausea inducing, it's quite sickening really.

Thank you so much! I thought I'd share an update and a crazy story. Don't worry, I won't post daily updates!

So I went to work this morning and was feeling pretty grumpy. I had a meeting first thing which I knew was going to be stressful even if I wasn't quitting. It was with some colleagues and my boss, who let's just say I find challenging even when I'm not in nicotine withdrawal. So halfway through the meeting she said something pretty rude to me, which I'm used to and just try to ignore because she's my boss after all. Well instead, today I replied to her: ""EXCUSE ME?!!!""

My heart was pounding. Everyone's jaw dropped. I was panicking. What did I just do?!! Seconds passed. Then she apologized. Twice. And pulled me aside later to apologize some more.

I lucked out here. I wasn't really in control of that situation and it easily could have gone another way. But I have to say I felt like a million bucks hearing her apologize to me over and over.

(And a very proud Day 7 for my husband!)

Things are getting easier. There have been a couple days this week that I've managed to go 4-6 hours without thinking about a smoke instead of fighting a craving every hour. The cravings are weaker and easier to distract myself from. 

I'm still struggling some with sleep. I've been feeling kind of zombie-ish the last week. Tired and bloated and like I've got a bit of a head cold. My anxiety and agitation are both on the intense side but my mood swings are calming down.

Mostly it just feels good though. Every crappy day has still been better than a day spent smoking. 

I particularly am coming to love:

* Not feeling like I have to smoke before I can go anywhere/do anything. I've mentioned this a few times on here but oh my god it's so annoying how everrryyyythingggggg starts being structured around cigarettes. And it makes anything you need to do feel like a massive chore. Even simple stuff. ""Ugh, gotta go CHECK THE MAILBOX. Guess I'll have a cig first. And one after."" Like what??? Just walk thirty feet and grab the mail it's not a hardship that you need cigarettes to get through 😆

* Not having to shower every time I leave the house to avoid smelling too much like smoke. Now I don't smell like smoke because I don't smoke anymore. That's pretty great.

* Not feeling like a loser every time my bonus kid is over and I miss time with them to step out on the porch and get my fix. Or feeling like a loser when they come outside with me to spend time and have to breathe my secondhand smoke. I don't wanna do that to my kid. 

* Looking healthier in general. My teeth already look so much better??? I don't know how that's possible in 2 weeks but they already look brighter. So do my eyes. My skin is a pimply mess right now but I know that'll go away too in a week or so. 

* Feeling healthier in general. Deep breaths come more easily and I haven't noticed my heart racing/pounding as often. My stamina is already starting to improve a bit and I feel less winded during activities. 

I'm sure there are other positives I haven't mentioned, but these are the big ones for me right now. And I know they'll only get better as time goes.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,128215,public,self,Day 14 :),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/q3aihi/day_14/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't seem to have any other withdrawal symptoms that I notice, but it's really tough to go through the constant struggle to not have racing thoughts and depression. 

I'd love to be able to get on meds for the depression, but I cannot afford them. I think they would help a lot, so it's something I may try to prioritize more. I am also in counseling and quitting smoking has been an ongoing topic with my therapist, but honestly, it hasn't helped. I feel that it only makes me feel more guilty, and it loads on more stress because I feel more pressured to quit for someone else. Not for me.

yesterday I (26) was at the pulmologist with my mother (60) and as expected she got bad news. 
She's smoking since her youth and the effects are getting bigger. I wasn't shocked when the doctor told her she has COPD. 
Her lung is wounded and she can't walk like 50 meters without almost passing out. 
The disappointing part is, that she is not able to stop smoking.
It's a topic we had for years. Part of why I stopped smoking half a year ago after 10 years was to be an example for her.
But she blocks every way I try to help her. 
My next try will be like a Presentation for her. I will show her in detail, but as easy as I can what COPD is and what a difference it would make to stop smoking. She really has her problems to understand the topic and I want to give her the chance to understand it. If she still don't want to stop smoking then, I will atleast have tried my best. I have to tell you, it's not easy to see your own mother slowly dying. That's why I won't ever give up fighting for her life.

I encourage everybody to try to stop smoking. I don't want to mention the bad effects of smoking, but I want you to see the chances of stopping.
I stopped 7 month 4 days and 15 hours ago and I don't regret it. 
It's the first time I had a success in my life where I am proud of every day that I reached it. I am more into sports since I stopped. I soon stopped coughing and now I only cough like ""normal"" people. I don't have the bad smell and I save alot of money.
The biggest point is that I enjoy to breathe now. 

Non-smoking has only benefits. I had some hard moments since I quit but I never needed a cigarette because I knew that it will cause problems than solving them. 
Nobody's perfect and I didn't succeed in my first try, but this time, although I'm an absolute pessimist, I'm safe to say that I'll never smoke again.
By the way. Think about your loved ones. I always hated it when friends said that I should stop smoking. But they just had the need to tell me this because the didn't want me to die early.

I've listened to the recording of Allen Carr's book *Easy Way to Stop Smoking* at least a dozen times now, and although the idea usually sticks for a while - I've ""cracked"" and smoked each time. And it's always a bummer!

Anyway. I read a comment on here once which said something along the lines of ""I'm a nonsmoker now. I don't smoke. I don't want to smoke. **If a meteor were headed for Earth to kill us all, I still wouldn't smoke.**"" And that last line always stuck with me!

I mean - if *a god damn meteor* were about to *kill us all*.... fuck it, right? Smoke up! 

And despite listening to that damn book over and over to make sure I fully understood every point and counter-argument to the shit my brain would come up with to justify smoking... I still never could get over that meteor thing. Because deep down I still believed it was actually an enjoyable experience to smoke and relieve my nicotine withdrawals. Which basically meant I'd never really gotten the point of that damn book lol.

I don't want to smoke. I don't ever want to smoke again. And I'm pretty I never wanted to smoke in the first place - except for those first few experimental times. What I want is to *not* want to smoke. Does that make sense? And for most of my life, the only way to get rid of that craving/urge to smoke was to just smoke. Yet the sick joke is that smoking is what perpetuates the eternal hell of always wanting to smoke. 

I don't want to smoke. I want to not want to smoke, and I do that by not smoking. Every time I think I want a cigarette - I realize ""no. I don't want a cigarette, I am having a trigger/craving/urge to do what I've always done. But that has not worked, and it will not ever work. I want to be free of this hellish nightmare of suffering feelings of withdrawal followed by feeling guilty for caving in."" And I do that by not smoking. And every day the nicotine leaves my body a bit more, and every day I train myself to react to triggers by not wanting to pursue that damned strategy I fooled myself into relying on.

And to that end - it's a relief to realize that as long as I've got my head screwed on right, I won't ever fall for the trick again. Not tomorrow and not next year, because if I plan on smoking again one day - to throw out all logic and self-preservation for a phantom of relief - then I might as well do it this very moment. Logical fallacies have a way of immediately collapsing the entire framework like that. I get it now. I don't want to smoke. I never want to smoke. Gun to my head, meteor headed right for the Earth, that sucks... but suggesting I smoke a cigarette is just as dumb of an idea as suggesting I shoot up heroin or bash my toe with hammer.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,128201,public,self,It's easier to quit when you know it's for good,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/q302rx/its_easier_to_quit_when_you_know_its_for_good/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,c533670e-6c35-11e9-9df3-0eab33e8d9a2,dark,,,,,,,,,,,1633577397.0,

My work had a lot of down time so almost everyone in the warehouse would sit around chain smoking. They would smoke in the trucks and at our delivery sites. Eventually it became too tempting and to relieve stress from work and school I began smoking as well.

At first it was just cigarillos. I would smoke one in the morning before class. They used to sell flavored cigarillos which made it easier to get into. Then one day I ran out, so I bummed a smoke from someone on campus. I realized they weren't as bad I thought they would be, and they were cheaper, so I started buying those instead.

Then it turned into a social thing. Hanging out with the other guys between class at the smoke pit and shooting the shit. Smoking in a circle in the warehouse with the other guys at work before our next delivery. Some of my other friends had started smoking as well so I would smoke a lot at parties. One cigarillo in the morning turned into about 8-12 smokes a day.

I still lived at home and had to hide it from my parents. I'm not sure how they couldn't smell it when I came home but I managed to hide it. One time they found an empty pack in my car and called me out on it. I said I had smoked some but had quit already, which was a lie. Then I kept smoking in secret. I knew it was an addiction.

Eventually the guys in my class started switching to vapes. This was in the somewhat early days of vaping around 2015. I picked up a cheap vape and found it was actually pretty easy to switch from cigarettes to the vape. The vape tasted better and at the time juice was pretty cheap. It was easier to hide and I could vape inside (I never smoked inside or in my car).

The cheap vape turned into sub-ohm mods, DIY coil wrapping, and bigger and bigger bottles of juice. It got more and more expensive. I didn't do the math but it might have been more expensive than smoking. Occasionally I would go back to smokes when I ran out of juice, but could switch back to the vape pretty easily.

It came to a point where I knew I couldn't keep vaping. But quitting vaping was incredibly hard. I tried and failed a dozen times. Vaping was too easy and too convenient and I couldn't resist it.

I made a promise 2 years ago that I would stop vaping. I failed, but kept it a secret. I hid it from the person I promised it to. The second time I lied and hid my addiction from someone close to me. I feel an immense amount of guilt for hiding it for so long.

My last vape was 2 weeks ago, and while I have constant cravings I've resisted so far. I'm doing NRT right now and it's helping.

It feels weird to say, but I miss standing out in the rain having a lonely smoke. I hope that feeling goes away eventually.

I can't share my 2 weeks of progress with anyone else since I supposedly ""quit"" 2 years ago. So I'm posting it here to get it off my chest.

No shit. But it took me 2 years to make me wanna quit. The main reason that left me to the decision was my mental helth. See smoking doesnt reduce my anxiety, it reduces the nicotine stress. I used my ciggarettes to damp my stress but in reality it only releaves my nicotine stress. Meditation is way better att calming nerves.

Im on day 3 of being smoke free.

I have no patience, i could fight anybody looking at med for too long at the street and i feel soo tired i dont know why. The urges of smoking a ciggarette keep popping up in my head every 15 min.
I just picture myself a life without ciggaretes and think to myself, why couldnt that be this life?
Also i need to safe money and i really really wanna get rid of the anxiety ciggarettes come with

As soon as the urges come i either eat alot of candy or i google up reasons why smoking is bad. I really dont care about dying, it honestly the opposit. I just dont want live my life with all this stress ciggarettes give me. 

I also draw tons of squares on a paper and now i have crossed 2 of them, having every 10th square withholding a prize like haircut or new pair of clothing.

I wish you look and i remember: ciggarettes doesnt kill your pain

Attempt 1 lasted 13 months, attempt 2 around 9 months. Attempts 3 and 4 weren't very impressive. in all those attempts, I began my first smoke-free day after chucking out all my cigarettes and lighters. and I ultimately relapsed.

what struck me now is that while I had successfully removed enablers in my previous attempts, i had never really worked on my own will power to deny the nicotine urge.

so, this time, I quit but with my ciggies all as it were on Sep 13th (when I smoked my last cigarette in this quit attempt). I still have an open pack of 8 cigarettes 3 meters away on the table - and, if I wanted to, I could light up within 3 seconds.

in my WFH desk I have six 10-packs lying unopened still (this was part of my routine: buy smokes over the weekend to last the entire coming week).

I still have back-up packs stashed everywhere (car, wardrobe, drawers, work laptop bag, desk in office, etc.). these were emergency packs in case I ran out in the course of normal life.

I still also have my other emergency they-may-announce-a-new-lockdown stash in my under-mattress storage - that's about another 10-12 packs, I guess?

Mom had smoke 50 yrs!  I’d begged her to quit. I hid her cigarettes. I threw them away. I put a no smoking sign in the bathroom!  She cut back. By the end, she maybe smoked 1 a day. It was always when working. She said she needed it.   I think she thought that she was safe. She would never get her lungs checked though. “I don’t want to know!” she’d say.  She started using a Breo inhaler about 3 years ago. That should’ve been a sign to get checked but she wouldn’t.   In 2020, as COVID began, she quit. She said she started smoking and just didn’t want it anymore.   She never wanted to smoke after that. 

I read something online that quitting suddenly can be an indicator that something has changed in the body. Probably cancer.   She began to lose weight. A mass was found in July 2021. She passed away September 21.   I don’t know why I’m writing this. Just wanted to share.  I hope everyone who is trying to quit is successful.

Longtime lurker, but finally found the courage to post here. 

Guys, I need advice. I'm trying to quit smoking for around a year now, after I reduced it to ""only weekends"". Smoked around half a pack a day for \~10 years. 

I'm always doing fine for a few weeks until social gatherings happen. A lot of my friends are heavy smokers and I get jealous all the time just looking at them smoking. Usually there is also quite a lot alcohol involved but even if I don't drink, I can't do it. Most of the times I can fight the urge to smoke for around an hour or so, but then I give in.

All the mental, physical and economical benefits of not smoking aside, there's something soothing about smoking that really calms me and I guess I'm a little afraid of letting that go. 

Been smoking for about 25 years and I really don't want to quit, but I decided that with the way the world is going, there's less and less space for smokers in it. Imagine being on holiday somewhere nice. You find a great looking cozy bar and they serve you a delicious cold beer, the sun is out and everything is perfect. You ask for an ashtray and are told that it's a non-smoking facility and you need to go behind that building on the other side of the street (without your drink) to have a cigarette. 

One of my reasons for wanting to quit this habit is to avoid the imagined scenario above. I remember when they banned indoor smoking in clubs/restaurants many years ago. I was furious at the time, but it only took a little while until it became the accepted norm. And now, even as a smoker, I would not like to see indoor smoking making a return. 

I decided to seek medical help to make the process easier on me. My doctor prescribed Champix, which is a 4-week treatment. I'm now on day 6, and much to my big surprise, it took over two hours this morning (even after a couple of cups of coffee) before I realized that I'd ""forgotten"" to smoke. The cravings simply weren't there as they use to be. It is advised to continue to smoke while taking the pills for the first half, as eventually smoking will induce nausea which will hopefully help with the psychological addiction.

I smoked cigarettes for 5 years and then vaped for like 8 years. I've quit so many times, but this year it was for good. I read Alan Carr's How to Stop Smoking the Easy Way and haven't looked back. There are SO many benefits to being nicotine free that I've been learning about every since I quit. This one really takes the cake though.

I used to have really bad insomnia. Like, some nights I just wouldn't be able to fall asleep for hours. There were times I actually had to call out of work because it wasn't safe for me to drive on 2-3 hours of sleep. I experienced insomnia at least once a week, sometimes more. The doctor wouldn't prescribe sleeping medication and recommended I take melatonin or benadryl before bed; both of which did next to nothing for me. So I was just kind of SOL for a long time.

Two weeks after quitting nicotine, I stopped having trouble falling asleep every night. It's MAGICAL getting in the bed and just...falling asleep. I rarely have any issues falling asleep now. If I've had a stressful day, maybe it takes me 20 minutes to fall asleep instead of 10.

Cravings stayed at 7-8 out of 10 for 6 months. Straight up. It finally got a little easier this summer. COVID helped since I’ve basically stopped going to bars which is where I did a lot of smoking, but don’t get me wrong, I had plenty of cravings at home alone too. 

I was heavily dependent on throat lozenges for the first six months also.  (menthol — the stronger the better. I needed something that burned). I was going through the 200ct family pack of Halls Sugar Free menthol a week. I still like one every now and then. But it’s more like one a day max, and usually just before bed. 

My grandma died last month. We were very closed….she practically raised me. The temptation to light up was there. It was hard not to relapse. But even still, that craving was at about a 5-6 compared to what it was like during early 2021. So it does get better. But, I wouldn’t say ids “easy” yet. Because I still have to be vigilant. Not trying to discourage you just want you to be realistic. 

For reference, I was a 15 year, pack a day smoker. Here was my day one post:

This time it's going better than last time, but I've had 2 or 3 small ""shotgun blast"" cravings where I was around people and decided to have a few drags. I felt guilty after each one, but never fell off and gave up. 

In the time since I quit. I've smoked the equivalent of about 3 cigs

Usually the next day or two I feel I might be slightly more irritated but I didn't fully cave.

Well, last weekend, my neighbor was randomly talking to me and invited me over for a couple beers. 3 in, he lights up a cig.. I was a piece of crap and asked for one and smoked it, bit drunk but no excuse.

Basically, I'm not completely powerless when I'm around an opportunity (definitely had like 5 + times where people were smoking and I did not try to ask for a cig.) But these fleeting moments where my mind says fuck it let's have half a cig or whatever on the weekend are definitely my biggest struggle rn.

Just exactly at that point where you start to feel like maybe it wasnt such a big deal to quit. I got to my sisters. Im staying a week at her apartment. She is gone right now. ....as im putting my things away ...corner of my eye catches SOME MARLBORO LIGHTS. WHAT!? SNUGGLED IN A TIN ON THE BOOKSHELF. WHAT IS HAPPENING MY SISTER DOESNT EVEN SMOKE!? MY HEAD BEGINS TO REEL. I THINK IM DIZZY IM SO EXCITED AND SHOOK. SHES NOT HERE I COULD SMOKE ONE AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW. WHERE IS THE LIGHTER!???

Remember why you quit. It will all come rushing back. Remember the misery. Quit for those who were never able to. Quit because fuck big tobacco. Fucking parasite/murderers.

I am 40 days in! not gunna lie i HAVE had a hard time with this and continue to. But im still glad Im doing it..I'm realizing cigarettes were a hugely toxic thing covering up issues i SERIOUSLY need to face in my life. Unaddressed depression/adhd. Holy freakin smokes. My mental health has gone buckwild since quitting. But i know i have to press on. I'm currently working on seeing if im deficient vitamine/mineral-wisw in anything...messing around with diet to see if theres any foods that might be contributing to the depression and acne breakouts. Started praying to check and see if God exists and if i could rely on such a one instead of earthly dopamine sources. Idk. I'm just shaking things up. Quitting smoking. When the fog cleared i could better see what needs work in my life. And the worry and guilt about smoking so much, about spending so much; feels really good to have that be gone. To be doing something i actually am proud of, flipping a bird to big tobacco. Finally. I remember all my tears in the beginning of this quit. Wanting so badly to be free while i sucked down cigarette after cigarette and could not stop. Fight me on this if you want but I do believe it is much harder to quit if you are depressed or adhd. Somehow that nicotine/dope hit is 3000001x more precious to you bc you were already starting from a place of lack of ""feel ok in life"" chemicals.  But it can be done.

That might seem off-putting to some, but I manage my use extremely well and believe drugs enhance my life. I use drugs proactively and with purpose, rather than reactively.

I was previously a heavy vaper for about two years, then I took Tabex which reduced, but didn't eliminate my use.  The past year or so my nicotine habits have been ""social"" or intermittent. Typically I'll buy a disposable vape on a Friday and kill it over the weekend.  Sometimes I'll indulge when I'm stressed like during exams season. 

My current dilemma is that some of my favorite other drugs, Adderall, alcohol, and Modafinil, trigger cravings. I haven't had nicotine in 2 weeks and took an Adderall this morning to get some work done; all I can do is think about walking down to the smoke shop and buying a vape. Alcohol is similar, typically I drink 2x/week; heavy (4-7 drinks) on Friday and moderate (2-3) on Saturday. I crave nicotine intensely when I'm drunk.

Now the obvious solution here is ""stop drinking"" and ""stop taking stimulants"" but as an introverted college student I have to be honest, I'm not willing to give up drinking.

I'm using patches, originally 25mg (that was way too high tbh, so I've just gone down to 21mg, expecting to feel slightly off for the next few days)

Proud of myself because I knew cold turkey was too scary for me, I have tried a few times but usually relapsed at 3 weeks due to depression, but I still haven't put a cigarette in my mouth for a whole month (apart from one slip, which I don't count as a relapse cos I didn't feel the need to continue, I just continued putting the patches on the following days), the patch helps a lot and I've had very little cravings, even hanging around other smokers (defo need to shake up my social circle tho, so I am around less people who could trigger me as I ween off patches too)

I'm going to start lowering my patch strength come halloween, so the end of this month, I'll go 14mg for 2 weeks and then 7mg for 2 weeks, I'm expecting it to be tough but I've been using this month to break the lifestyle addiction and learn as much about quitting as I can and strengthening my resolve.

I haven't been a smoker for long, only about a year and a half, so I know I should quit sooner rather than later as I'm just making it harder for future me, and I don't see a future for myself where I continue smoking, my lungs were already feeling it and I struggled to run 1km, where I was previously a super sporty person.

I think what has helped my recovery is I'm not *just* quitting smoking, I'm building up my whole life, replacing bad habits with good ones etc, finding things to look forward to, making huge changes... eg I started a new job, been going to the gym for zumba classes, yoga.. I started brazillian jiu jitsu, I'm looking at other hobbies and classes to try and theres a board game club I'll be going to on saturdays, I have spent a lot of time thinking about my future and what I want and I even have a mild career path/direction, and once I'm at my next job in a few months (in warehouse right now, plan to move to office work), I'll have my evenings free and more stuff to do, cos that's what I need, I smoked cos I was depressed cos my life sucked, so I'm making my life a good one.

Anyway, this is turning into a ramble, just wanted to join the conversation and share my own thoughts and experiences so far.

Thanks to the cost in Ireland, £14.30/Pack of 20.  I started saving those money in a separate e-wallet and on completing 200 days I will gift myself something special.  I am loving the cumulative. 

How I feel now?

\-- There is a change in my breathing. I stopped taking a deep breath with open mouth after an interval. 

\-- I snore less now.

\--I no more hate sweetness in food. 

\--I don't feel tired whole day and also yawn less and don't fear for aerobic activities. 

\--Drinking alcohol without smoking was no fun for me. So, my drinking habit made a sharp decline just like the economy after the covid lockdown, and during this period I drank around 5-6 times which was earlier 3-4 times a week. 

\--I learned the relation between pressure with smoke. Now, I don't take unnecessary pressure just to find an excuse to smoke. 

\--My digestion is also getting better after the decrease of alcohol and smoking combo. 

\--I get more time for myself. Take this as an eg. I am sharing this on a Sunday morning at 9am. Previously, Sunday morning was reserved for a hangover.

All this changes in just 5 months. I just hope I can continue. I take this as a milestone.

My name is Matej and I thought this might be a good place to present our idea. In October we are launching our first Kickstarter campaign where we will present an essential oil inhaler Kiff. Kiff is an all-new wooden essential oil inhaler that has been designed to alleviate feelings of stress and anxiety. The reason we created Kiff is to help people quit bad habits such as smoking and solve problems that motivate people to pick them up in the first place.

I quit back in 2013 and hadn’t smoked anything at all for 8 years. Long story short my wife passed away about 2.5 years ago and I went through some hard times.

After 14 years of smoking I just stopped. Cold Turkey. 

I feel good, but sometimes still have cravings.

But after al these days without smoking, it gets easier to convince yourself that you’re a non-smoker now. Cravings are just a thought about smoking again. Enjoying this  thoughts and letting them pass again, is how I cope with them. 

**benefits of stopping:**
- Breathing gets easier, no more coughing all the time.
- You don’t smell like an ashtray, in fact you smell good.
- No more interruptions throughout your day.
- No more mood swings depending on your nicotine level. 
- Being able to exercise a again.
- Not having to part from a group to ply your lonely vice.
- Not having to stand in the cold or rain, because you don’t have a choice.
- Freedom

**How to stop (How I did it):**
- Plan your last cigarette.
- Smoke your last cigarette at night before sleep (wake up as a non-smoker).
- Drink a glass of water when you have cravings. Enjoy how the water tastes better over time. 
- When having a bad craving, go to the supermarket and buy yourself a treat, something sweet. Donuts worked for me. I bought 2 or 3 Donuts and I was good for a bad day.
- Don’t  drink coffee the first 2 weeks. After 2 weeks it gets easier to just drink coffee without craving a cigarette. You’ll be happy just being able to drink coffee again. Don’t drink too much though, use it as a coping mechanism Whenever you have cravings to smoke, just enjoy the coffee instead.
- Enjoy other people’s smoke, don’t avoid it. Have the sweet memories of smoking and accept that those days are behind you. That you’re feeling much better physically. And that the journey is totally worth it.

Smokers needed for a completely remote research study.

Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina have launched a new study to examine the effects of remote sampling of cessation medications. The research study involves initial online screening, 6 contacts over 6 months, daily smoking diaries for a month, and a chance to try nicotine patches or varenicline– you never have to come into our office, there’s no pressure to quit, and free cessation medication may be offered. Compensation is available for those who are eligible and participate. For more information, click the link below:

How do you guys deal with stress?

Unfortunately, I don't mean day to day, ""normal"" stressors, like work and bills and arguments with the SO. I have a special needs teen, elderly parents with severe health issues, a vindictive ex who won't stay out of my life, and zero support (for the day to day as well as quitting). I don't get a break from the BS flying at me, and on any given day it's all I can do to not start screaming, even without trying to quit. It seems like every time I try, or even just plan to quit, it amps up significantly. This go round, in the weeks leading up to my planned quit day my landlord informed me that he's renovating and I have to move by the end of the month, my father has fallen ill, my daughter is having daily meltdowns (she has ASD), the ex abruptly stopped paying support, the car broke down, and my cat needs surgery. Yep.

Quit day was today, and I went for I regardles. It went well for almost two hours, but probably because I was up hours before anyone else, and had quiet. Once the kiddo was up and the parents were calling, I found myself in the RoFo parking lot with a full pack in hand and hating myself.

Things are not going to change anytime soon, so I have to find a way to handle it, but I'm at a loss. I've tried breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, going for walks, etc, and it only helps as long as I'm able to continue actively doing it. I have to work, so it's not as if I can just spend all day trying to destress. Due to allergies, NRT and meds are not options for me, nor is any kind of medication for stress (yay).

I feel amazing; I'm happy, I'm exercising regularly, the house has never been cleaner. I feel like I able to devote more energy to things I would usually put off. I've got savings for the first time in what feels like ages. I can run 8k without feeling exhausted. I'm just hoping that I can keep this up.

I'd failed quitting about 3-5 times in a row before this attempt. I would buy a pack, smoke one then run it under the taps in frustration. I didn't think this was going to be a successful attempt. The first three days were shit. Felt like smashing my head into a wall. Nearly cracked every single day, even to the extent of going to the shops and then dragging my sorry addict self back home without buying anything. It was so rough I couldn't possibly have imagined that this attempt at quitting would be one that would last this long. I'm glad I persisted.  
The next week after was much easier. The 'I want to die' and the 'I can't function without a cigarette' cravings became more manageable. What was in their place though was the 'wouldn't it be nice if you had a smoke right now' thoughts. They're so subtle, seemingly so sensible that  they're almost convincing. You only realise through time that they're just as much part of the addiction as the withdrawals are.  


Around this time I started exercising, at first short walks, then small body weight exercises. By week 2 I was running and lifting weights. If there was one thing that stopped me from smoking in that time it was that. You get excited about how much you can lift and how far you can run the next day. Instead of sitting in bed at night thinking about the morning dart, you're planning out the route you're going to ride. The thought of ruining the progress of my exercise (and awful thought of having to go through the heavy withdrawals again) kept me honest.   


I haven't left nicotine behind me yet, I feel like it might be 3 months before I can say that I've truly beaten the addiction. Day to day I don't really have any cravings, but there's still the odd thought of smoking every now and again. I definitely still get cravings when I drink, so I've learned to stay away from alcohol, or drink light beer so that it's a little more manageable. But I'm hopeful this is going to continue. I'm looking forward to writing my 3 month post. To those who gave me advice and support through the tough times, thank you. To those going through the early days, or have just had a failed attempt, just know it's definitely worth sticking out to get to this point.

It's been a little rough lately and I'm suddenly having an urge to smoke a cig. I spent a solid 6 months not having any cravings whatsoever but now I'm just lonely and there's no one to stop me ( except for myself). I've been smoking for over 6-7years , on and off several times but not this long.

Everyone got their own story but for me it was depression and things along the way. Right now I'm just fighting my battle and I know I wouldn't have minded this much for smoking to just calm my nerves but you know, when I start and get going its like I smoke multiple times, chain smoking.

I'm so glad I found this community, as I really need to feel like I'm quitting this nasty habit with others.

I stopped smoking a year and a half ago alongside my mum, after many failed attempts solo. We used the patches and gum (took a good few months to give the gum up too), but it was honestly the fact that we were in it together that majorly helped me! 

2 months ago, I got my ADHD diagnosis, and was put on a generic form of ritalin. Around the same time, I went through a painful breakup, and immediately went to buy cigarettes, didn't even give it a second thought.

I then bought the gum again, as I started a full time job (my first, after being a self employed fitness instructor for the last few years), and it's pretty full on and stressful, as well a physically demanding, so wanted to have the comfort of knowing I could have a nicotine fix without the cigarettes. 

What did I end up doing instead?

Smoking AND chewing gum. I'm a genius...

And now I need to stop this before it goes on any further.

I don't know what it is, but the diagnosis kind of affirmed my impulses and almost provided me with an excuse (it's my ADHD, oopsies, so impulsive, not my fault). 

It's morning, I'm on my way to work, have had a cigarette, but no gum. The gum really hurts my stomach, I chew a ton of the stuff

I'm so anxious about the prospect of having nothing to provide me with an escape or a release, so I've come here.

Can anyone give me any tips? Or even words of encouragement are greatly appreciated.

I have a question that I am hoping some of you can shed some light on.

I've never used any nicotine products before a couple of days ago. I bought some Amazon Basics branded cherry 4mg lozenges as a replacement for a smokeless tobacco habit, and I've found.them almost intolerable. I'm wondering if my experience is brand specific or if this is pretty standard with lozenge.

So, what I am referring to is basically the way it dissolved slowly into a kind of goop that coats the mouth. Its as if the lozenge doesn't dissolve so much as it slowly absorbs saliva which turns it slimy and you have to suck the slime off of it to allow it to absorb more saliva and repeat.

Anyone experience this with other brands? I can understand.why they might have engineered this into the product to make sure it can't dissolve too quickly, but its such a negative experience that I can't ever suggest it as a reasonable way to quit tobacco to anyone.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127953,public,self,Amazon nicotine lozengeshey,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pyssxp/amazon_nicotine_lozengeshey/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe you should by a pack, and carry it around to remind yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Just remember, that only 15% procent of people with lung cancer are alive after 5 years after the diagnosis, and some 80% are dead within 2 years.

You will slowly drown in your own fluids over those 2-5 years, while feeling like shit 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

You will most likely lose your mind as well, as these type of cancers have a nice little habbit of spreading to the brain as well.  About 20 to 40 percent of adults with non-small cell lung cancer go on to develop brain metastases at some point during their illness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, don't forget how everyone around you will be devastated in the process of seing you turn into a living mummy and eventually die-off.

&amp;#x200B;

Also remember that the risk of getting lung cancer as a former heavy smoker is almost four times higher than a never-smoker even 25 years after quitting.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you don't get it you will still acounter these issues amongst many others if you continue:

You will be out of breath.

You will never be at your best. 

You will look older than you are.

Many people will avoid being near, you and developing relationships with you. 

You will waste a lot of time, and money.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel great, and i look great, and i am much stronger now, than i was a year ago! My urges to smoke are very rare, and easy to control! Keep on following the right path for you! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this post will make it easier for someone to quit.

I started smoking at I think 19 or 20. I'm 35 now. Several times I've tried to quit. I think the longest I ever went was a few month in my 20s and once for about 4 months five years ago. I've tried cold turkey methods with guidance, I've also tried patches or vaping instead of smoking. Vaping of course works, its just expensive and a lot of the motivation is the cost. Patches are much cheaper in my country. Though its still hard to just use the patch and nothing else. Anyway what really forces me back into it more than anything else is anger. 

I know irritability is a common side effect of withdrawal. The thing is even as a smoker I can be an irritable person. I have actually talked to a therapist about it but I can't afford to see one right now. Little stuff does frustrate me and while I have been verbally temperamental at times I have never in my life been violent. I just get worked up about little stuff and can give you a nice long rant. 

But when I don't have nicotine in my system, frankly, I frighten myself. My thoughts are not just ""irritability"", they are violent thoughts. Something in politics or entertainment will annoy me and I start having violent fantasies about the person in question. I'll start to fantasize about scenarios that haven't even happened and get images in my mind that are really disturbing and violent. I feel not just irritable but frankly consumed by a homicidal rage. And I know the only thing that will make them go away is nicotine. This can't be normal. I've tried so many times to quit and always I go right back to it because even though I hate myself as a smoker I hate myself when I'm not smoking so much more. I want everyone to know I can say with 100% certainty that I am not violent in actions and never would be. I've never hurt anyone, I'm not a dangerous psychotic, I promise you so please I'm being very vulnerable by admitting that this goes on inside me. I don't like that I think these things and what I'm trying to figure out is if anyone elses thoughts are so extreme when they are in withdrawl and if they ever stopped if so. When ""irritability"" is listed as a symptom, that doesn't feel like it describes the intensity of these feelings of raw hatred. I'm scared to be around people. I know I wouldn't hurt anyone but I might express the feeling and scare them away. So I smoke. And I hate it. And yet I feel like I pretty much have to just give up and live with being a smoker for the rest of my life. It might be less depressing than the constant failure to quit and these thoughts that plague my brain every time I try to quit.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127896,public,self,Violent Thoughts and Withdrawal,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pxnnfx/violent_thoughts_and_withdrawal/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I’m picking myself up, dusting myself off, and continuing to go after 8 fewer cigarettes. Obviously not smoking would have been better, but I’m giving myself compassion. I’m only human.

The following triggers were there for me:

1) Somebody left their cigarettes in the break room

2) I was having a REALLY, REALLY crappy Monday. Like, considering turning in my notice crappy.

3) I had to deal with a poopy, disgusting, clogged toilet at work (janitorial position) which

4) Was not fixed after a solid plunge

Again, I’m only human and a lot of people  would have wanted something to take the edge off in that case. The best thing I can do is be prepared to deal with such a trigger before it happens again.

I'm having a horrible day thinking about how bad my habit is. Talking with a friend about all the niche things like potential baby issues, cold turkey, the things I've tried. The fact of the matter is none of it puts me mentally ready to quit. Wife sent me something to help the oral fixation but I've even tried pacifiers before. 

I'm tired of spending 400 a month on smokes. I'm tired of feeling the way I do. And I'm tired of affecting those around me. But mentally I don't feel strong enough or ready enough especially when smoking 2 or more packs a day. 

Don't know if I'm looking for advice or just ranting. I know people quit and go through relapses. I don't have a very addictive personality but this is just one of those things I can't shake.

I can't guarantee you will never smoke again, and you shouldn't too. It's a day by day process, it's about what you want.

This is a 'I couldn't quit but I've cut right down' post. Mainly because I'm over an extremely stressful time in my life (lost job and ex partner in the same month). Here's what I've noticed for those who are still on 20 a day. 

\- If you're male, smoking DEFINITELY affects your sex life. Time it takes to get hard. Endurance. Size. Girth. Yeah. Since I cut right down my new g/f says she feels like I am 'bigger'. I can also last longer. 

\- Naturally, only on five a day I'm only buying a pack once every four days. Money saved. 

\- My appetite has increased. I actually feel properly hungry now and eating doesn't feel like a chore that I have to do because it's the right time of day. 

\- I'm not coughing constantly in the morning. 

\- A few hours after waking up I feel like I am full of energy and have a mega amount of stamina. In the gym I can train for at least 30 mins longer and the pump I get is unreal. 

The plan is to quit completely (eventually). Not sure when. Take it from me though, if you're still smoking 20 a day you kinda get used to feeling a certain way and it feels like that's how life feels. It's not. I use the Quickmist here in the UK and only smoke after a meal. Kinda when I enjoy it the most, like most people. 

If you can't quit, or you keep trying to quit but can't, get some fast acting NRT and only smoke when you really feel like having one.

I'm 24, been smoking (and vaping, snuffing...) for ±10 years, quit just yesterday. Now, these numbers are nowhere near as impressive as coming from people with an addiction longer than my lifespan. Still, it sucked growing up with cigarettes and ""the miraculous alternative"" that vaping seemed to be. 

I took a plastic bag and gathered nicotine paraphernalia that I can throw out. Swelling with pride, I walked up to my mum, telling her ""think I won't need then anymore in my life"". She asked why, I explained briefly how damaging it was. When I was done going over health effects of smoking, she looked at me, half pitiful, half disdainful:

""...and you just found out?""

Now, for the context, I'm taking a medical major, so I'm literally required to know that. She's never smoked herself, so probably not envy. Plus I've had some things I tried to quit in the past, and she's been nothing short of perfectly supportive. So, why this?

I immediately regretted telling her and went outside to throw this bag out. Needless to say, I spent some time sobbing and went back straight to the bathroom to somehow conceal my red eyes. She entered and I said how inappropriate this was. Apparently it was meant to be a ""joke"". That's even fucking worse then, I'd rather be genuinely discouraged. 

What sucks the most though is how lightly she took it, having personally known a dude who died from smoking related lung cancer. This dude was my age when he died. And he continued smoking days before his death.

I have been a smoker since 2010 and burn 4 to 5 cigarettes on average everyday. Sometimes over a pack of 10 in a day. A couple weeks back it just occurred to me to quit smoking. It's been over 15 days now that I haven't tasted nicotine.

I was able to suppress the urge by keeping myself busy with work, reading, netflix. 

I have also gone without smoking for a whole month during the Ramadan fasts. The hunger was a good distraction. But now, I don't think I can stay calmly without smoking. I get anxious, have difficulty breathing and cannot concentrate in my work.

I have compulsions sometimes to bite my nails, clench my wrists tight, repeatedly crack my knuckles and neck. These compulsions are getting amplified every minute.

I'm only 34. My first drag was closer to 8 y/o, but I grew up in smokey houses and smokey cars, so really I've been addicted to nicotine pretty much my whole life.

I've quit many times before or as I decided to phrase it, I ""practiced quitting"" many times. Only 3 times did I last over six months. First time was when I was pregnant(kiddo is now 13), second time I quit 2 months shy of 5 years(!) I thought I was free and done forever! Then some stuff got super messy and I started again. All it takes is ONE... *sigh* then a couple of months after I restarted I quit for 3 months and then 6 months, and several other times as well. I fought it, but I failed. Now I've been regularly smoking for oh, I'm not exactly sure, but probably close to two years again. 
I don't like smoking. I don't enjoy the taste, the drags, the exhale, the smell, any of it.
When I quit for almost 5 years, I went from cigarettes to having vape in the morning, moved my cigarettes later in the day, until I was only vaping, then worked my nicotine down to 0 MG, then vaped later in the day until it was days between, then months, I kept my vape charged and within reach for six months after I quit. 
That just sounds like a lot to go through right now, I just want to be done. So I'm going to try the quitsure.
I'm just ready to be done, yet I keep picking up cigarettes... I had swapped to vape again a few months ago, but I  haven't even been using my vape lately at all, just keep smoking...
I smoke about half a pack a day consistently, more when I drink which is about a couple times a week 2 weeks a month.

- My health has never been worse. That is, I’m fatter than ever and have somehow got some pretty serious stomach and bowel issues which started at almost exactly the same time as giving up. (Probably from the binge eating and the over exercising combo.)   
- I would still love a ciggie sometimes. 
- I know I can still lapse at any moment. I know I can still lapse at any moment. I know.

I am delighted that it has been 6 months since I had a cigarette in my car! 6 months of a smoke free home, 6 months of never buying a packet, 6 months of walking around my home without always carrying a packet and a lighter…. 6 months of freedom! 6 months of cuddles with my nieces and nephews and family and friends without any fear and/or guilt and shame of stinking! 6 months of delicious food and drink… money and pride!!! 6 months of enjoying the warm inside and coffee breaks uninterrupted, 6 months of really listening and connecting to people without the mind taking me off to that nicotine craving. 6 months of not being distracted by my addiction every moment…… 6 months closer to taking that last EVER puff.

I've quit 71 days ago, and I can say that for now I usually don't think about smoking or miss it. Honestly.  Yes, there are some days when I think about It, but rather about weird psychological tension in my chest like when you have cravings. 

But goal of my post in the next:

When we have fear, anxiety or something like that usually these feelings place in the middle of the chest, this is the place where fears usually feels, center place. Every person, doesn't matter smoker or not, feels these feelings often in this place in the body.

But where we feel desire to smoke (cravings) ?

In my experience, It is the same place, in the chest, because lack of nicotine make us anxious.

And when we quit smoking, even in months, sometimes when we feel us sad or anxious we MAY think that It's cravings BUT in the real it's is just anxiety or another emotion in the chest.

So don't let your brain mix cravings with feelings when you feel sad or somewhat else.

It needs sometime to rewire our brains and find out that these feelings in the chest are not signs of the cravings. 

Also I want to notice that very big help gives mindfulness practice especially when we have cravings. It learn us to let it go. One of the important skills especially when we try to free ourselves in our inner space is observe and let it go. not pressure. but just letting go.

This way we can save our energy and don't feel us overloaded.

You'll let it go in one day totally, this feeling that you're smoker, or you are ex-smoker, or you hate smoking or romanticize it. In one day you'll just let smoking in your head disappear. When you won't overthinking about It. You'll know just fact that you were smoker and now you are free.

But don't hurry and don't make too pressure in you. If you feel yourself right now sad about your decision to stop, you should know, you'll be better. 100%. 

If you feel overwhelmed about your decision, just do step by step. You'll see you'll be better.

For example, only one month ago I felt myself very different and harder than I feel now. 

I don't want to describe all these changes and benefits. You can check out my post where I describe benefits after 1 month. And imagine that It become more and more visible and sensible.

Good luck, you should know you can do it if you really want, I know sometimes you feel like you can't, but just go forward and you'll see.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127837,public,self,71 days.

I have smoked since I'm 22 years old and it was over the stupidiest reason ever: wanting to fit in with a new group of friends (the friends didn't last but damn the addiction did). It has been almost 8 years since then, and I've been talking about quiting for at least 4 of it, so I can see why I won't take myself that seriously anymore. I never intended to smoke for long, I just felt in an addiction that was custom made for someone as anxious and compulsive as I am.

This year I finally got my shit together and got to spend one month without it (I'd smoke very rarely one or two, but still counted as quitting). I didn't use any help, just plain will power, which was very hard but made me proud of myself. Unfortunately I relapsed when one of my best friends had a very awful psychotic breakdown and I had to babysit him for months, the stress simply got me and therefore for this one I forgive myself. Around june I decided it was time to do it again, this time with the help of bupoprione, and it was actually pretty easy. I don't think it was only because of the medication, but also because I had the right mindset at the time, THAT one reddit is always saying you need to have in order to actually quit. After a month totally free I even dropped the medication because I was honestly feeling in complete control, happy as never, no coughs, barelly any breathing issues, no stinky clothes and room, not even suffering while hanging with other smokers (I do smoke week though, which helped with these social cravings specifically). Then last month I traveled with my boyfriend, who likes to smoke socially but has no problem not doing it in front of me. I'm not sure how it happened but we decided to buy just a few cigarretes to take for camping, since it was a bit of a tradition back when I used to smoke, and I remember how terrible and completely scared I felt while puffing it again, and of course just a few units became a few packs and soon I was back on it. I know that it isn't my SO responsability to take care of me or my decisions, but I felt very let down for how easy it was for him to just let me relapse while knowing how hard it was for me (but I also understand him, since I'd be on loops saying 'it's ok, with the medication is easy, I will be one of these people who quit whenever they want and that's it'. Yeah right.). 

Anyways, the medication didn't help this time simply because I lost that right mindset needed. Up to that I did a full medical check up and it seems like although smoking clearly makes me cough and gets me throath pain, I am healthier as never. No ashma, no allergies, not a single respiratory issue to be worried about, and I also don't have kids or anyone to 'take into consideration'. I know this sounds insane, but the fear of immediate health issues was a great motivator, and now more than never I need to do it just out of my will, just for knowing it will be bad on the future, just for not liking to be a smoker and this will have to do it, I guess, but damn that's hard.

I've decided to do it again. Tomorrow is the day. I don't have buproprione anymore and I'd take a long time to get it again, so I've bought a few nicotine tablets, lots of cinnamon candy and a couple of shitty red-label cigarretes as well. My plan is to wake up, clean my room (and the disgusting ashes around) and dedicate all my free time on listening Allen Carr's audiobook (that's what the cigarrettes are for, also if it gets really difficult to resist relapsing at least I'll do it with something that reminds me how bad it can be.). I've tried all of these before and none has worked because I didn't have this mtfking mindset, but I can't give up so that's how my strategy will go this time. I'm desperate and honestly sick of dealing with this for so long, I'm utterly mad and willing to use this on my favor. Also, I hope this time I've learned the lesson: it. is. never. just. one.

Thank you guys for reading, I'm currently the only person around me actually wanting to quit and it can get very lonely. Do you guys have any other tips to help me? Does anyone want to be my quitting buddy? God, I really hope I get it right this time.

Quitting smoking is one of the most challenging things I've ever done, mentally and physically. But it has been the best decision I made in my life. 

Beyond the excellent health benefits [(check out the improvement on my gums!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/73vub5/before_after_quitting_smoking_four_years_of_gum/), quitting helped me really feel like I was in charge of my life. It helped me realize that I could do what I wanted, could make the decisions I needed. 

I could be stronger than addiction, social pressure, marketing pressure - all of it. 

When I first quit, I counted every single day without a cigarette, and I was convinced that I would spend the rest of my life wishing to have another. 

3000 days later and I only know because of this sub.

Honestly, the last year, I haven't even thought about cigarettes. (Also was a pipe smoker, and cigars, and vaping). Neither lusted for them, nor hated them. Just completely out of sight out of mind. Indifferent. Forgot I was even a smoker, except for the odd times that I smelled it and thought ""Oh, a smoker. Didn't I used to be like that? Smells kind of unpleasant."" 

I have no right to tell you how to live your life and all, but for me - I don't miss it at all, and... you know,...it's not great. It's just... normal. No triumph - just normal blandness. Tobacco's not some magic pixie dust, nor is it some insurmountable demon. It's just something you don't think about. I have no doubt that I won't ever smoke again. I know current quitters have tough problems, and it's not that easy, but just accept this: **You're a non-smoker. You're normal.** Non-smokers don't even think about cigarettes. Cigarettes? What? Wtf is that? **Smokers are people who think about smoking. Non-smokers don't even notice it.**

I had quit vaping (which I had picked up to stop smoking) at new years of 2021. 6 months later, during a time where I decided to not drink for a while either, I had thought I was strong enough, feeling good enough, in control enough, to have a cigarette while visiting a friend.

This obviously meant I was OK to smoke while I wasn't drinking and hanging out with smokers. This then meant I was OK to smoke when I *was* drinking and hanging out with smokers. This then meant I was OK to have a cigarette when drinking and hanging out with non-smokers. This then meant I was OK to smoke in the day, just by myself, and here I am all over again. The slope is indeed very slippery, and rationalised all the way through.

I end up hating myself for this regression, and realisation that I can't control it without a change. Here I am for day 1 again - along with not drinking for a month to get past the initial phase. I'll be visiting here whenever I feel tempted, and am looking forward to that feeling when I had indeed quit for a while, where smoking wasn't on my mind whatsoever.

I quit smoking in Dec 2018. Cold turkey, full stop. I had a week-long relapse in Jul 2019 (stemming from the desire to just have ""one"" cigarette with a beer on the patio) and stopped it from going any further. I felt so *strong* and almost kind of smug. I kicked its ass and walked away. 

My husband quit in Sep 2019, on our wedding day. We went on honeymoon and actually got to enjoy ourselves instead of stopping every hour to refill with nicotine. 

In Dec 2019 my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I almost relapsed. In Apr 2020 my brother died suddenly. I started smoking at the viewing. 

Three months later my husband started smoking again too. 

Since then I've had four attempted quits. Each lasted between 2 days and 2 weeks and then the stress became unbearable.

Two nights ago I went out for my last cig of the night and it tasted like I was smoking straight ammonia. Like just insanely gross and acrid. I have no idea why - I'd smoked the whole rest of the pack without issue. Something about that last one just really tasted disgusting. And I put it out immediately.

Yesterday I couldn't bring myself to want to smoke, the memory of that taste still fresh in my mind. Around 8pm I got a little antsy for one, but I realized I was almost at 24 hours and it seemed dumb to give up that progress for something I don't even actually need.

Today is hard. My husband got up and got his coffee and went outside to smoke and my addiction monster keeps telling me I could just have one. Isn't it nice to sit in the sunshine? Isn't the weather particularly nice out? Isn't this the kind of day you wait all year for, balanced between summer warmth and fall chill? 

Yes. But none of it is made better by a cigarette. And I know that. I know it to my very core that it's a beautiful lie. The cigarette will always be the least enjoyable part of (what it tells me) it enhances. In reality it enhances nothing. It's a useless, smelly, expensive anchor. And I hate that I want it right now.

36 hours have elapsed. I know I'm halfway through the worst of it and I'm trying to hold onto that. I'm just so frustrated with all of it. I'm mad at myself more than anything for being back here again. And I know the way to make it up to myself is to succeed. And I know I've found success before. But right now it's hard not to be down on myself.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127759,public,self,Back on the wagon and trying to stay on,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pv8llx/back_on_the_wagon_and_trying_to_stay_on/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,2b357f16-6c35-11e9-aa04-0e82ca86a7f6,dark,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve been planning a quit strategy for a few months in preparation to this stage, with strong motivation that I wouldn’t go through a second pregnancy smoking throughout again. The guilt is debilitating, but I won’t go into that right now. I will just say, I’ve even attended psychologist sessions to find if I could find some underlying reason to why cigarettes are so deeply wired into my ability to function. 

I’ve attempted quit many times now. Even after even a few hours, I get crazy. Like, I start frothing with rage, act like I’m possessed, have tantrums, wail crying, just severe withdrawals. I know withdrawals are hard, but I don’t think the way I have them are far from normal. 

So I found out I’m pregnant, went slow with the pack I had left, got all my gum, nibbles etc ready. Wrote a journal entry telling cigs to F off and began my quit at 5pm yesterday. I already had an episode around 7pm after dinner, had to hide myself in the bedroom closet but my 1.5yr old saw bits of me sobbing and it infuriated me further. Woke up at 7am and 8:30am again I had a massive tantrum acting like I was possessed screaming into my pillow and at am I told my husband this wasn’t worth it and had a smoke. 


I’ve read Allen Carr, know everything about nicotine addiction, power of the mind. Like I’ve done my research. I’m willing to go through the temporary pain, but the withdrawals. When they’re there, I lose my self completely.

Today my partner told me to go back to England and leave him, because we want different things. And in that moment the only comfort I could think of was to smoke, so I went to buy tobacco and smoked a cigarette. I fucked up what I worked very hard for under the circumstances.

I quit about 3 times so far.

The first time I quit was 4 years ago. I quit cold turkey every time. 4 months after quitting, I went on a trip abroad. I don't travel abroad much; while I was there, the climate was different. It was vacation, and I decided why not smoke here, try cigarettes from a foreign country and not smoke when I get back home. Well, it wasn't long when I started smoking 1 cigarette a day and back to pack in a month.

The second time when I quit. Same story, different circumstances, this time I was in my home country.

The most recent attempt was about 3 months ago, I quit, and it was going well; I joined a gym, started waking up early etc.

The problem is, every time I drink, I have an uncontrollable urge to smoke, and I promise myself I won't smoke the next day. And this happened very well for about two months.

I am amazed by the ability of some of my friends. They don't smoke while drinking. On infrequent occasions, about 1/10th time we drink, they ask for smoke and enjoy it. They'll never touch a cigarette for the next 6 months or year. Another friend of mine smokes while drinking, we're out of town in some countryside, and the weather is cold and beautiful. He rarely smokes in his hometown and is sober.

I'd love to know what has worked for you all, what has not helped, anything and everything.

His biggest fears right now are stress and boredom. He loves smoke breaks as a reason to walk away from a conversation and think about it, and he also likes the change of scenery (we're in the same industry and can work 16 hour days for weeks at a time). I've seen suggestions like a ""craving bag"" of candies, gum, etc. I personally know many folks who swear by breathing through a straw, but he thinks it's stupid and I'm not sure he can be convinced otherwise, ha.

Also, aside from tips and tricks, what's the language that can help? I really don't want to pressure him, but of course I naturally want to help remind him to stay on track. I'm worried my ""keep at it"" attitude could stress/annoy him into wanting a cigarette more. What's the least aggravating way to provide support?

Anyway, what I have so far is to make kinda three lists: Reasons to stop smoking and its benefits, reasons why he wants to smoke, and things to do instead of that last list. I'm hoping having something to look at on paper can be a good reminder and such.

I was late twenties. That was a wake up punch. I wasn't in the hospital related to respiratory issues, just pre operation testing.

2)  An old man I know quit too, after I guess 50 years of smoking. Him quitting didn't mean much to me, but the way he did it. He said: **You can't think of stopping smoking as ""NEVER smoking again"", you can only think of it as ""you are not smoking NOW"". That is the key attitude in stopping smoking.**

That was brilliant. It is infinitely less burden, less draining, less of a mental weight to think of it as just not smoking this moment. Just this moment, not today, this hour or anything. Just NOW. The never smoking again path/attitude is such a pain, its like carrying a chain with you at all times, it is unsustainable. Imagine forbidding yourself from doing anything ever again, its a horrible feeling.  Its also depressing as shit.

Imagine when you are badly tempted, one of those moments where everything seems meaningless if you just don't light just one sweet cigarette and puff away all of the turmoil. In those moments, if you go by Never mindset, you say to yourself, No no no no, and fight your urges. Excruciatingly. Such a waste of energy. Such anguish. Beating yourself up by yourself. Impossible. And when you exhaust yourself you of course succumb. 

Now imagine the opposite. You get in that hole of despair and you tell yourself, okay in five minutes I'll have one. What happens is that your body calms because all of the craving parts of you have a resolution. They will get what they want in just a few minutes.  No fight with yourself, no mental push/pull. And urges last less than five minutes, which is convenient :), and also lose power over time and ultimately go away. When I stopped I carried a pack of smokes with me for couple of months, just so whenever I had a desire to smoke, I could say to myself; okay, in five minutes I will light up one. No fear, cigarettes are in my pocket and only minutes away from my mouth and my lungs. And in five minutes, I didn't want one anymore, actually I wouldn't even think of it anymore. Please try it. It sounds way too simple but it effing works. 

3) Last is a little mental rewrite. **Cigarettes are not calming, sedating or in any way helping you relax.** They are relaxing your physical addiction to cigarettes. You didn't need them before you started doing them. You smoke, get addicted, crave them, craving makes you uneasy, you smoke them, you relax the craving, some time passes, you crave again... They are not friends.

I (23M) have been a smoker for 5 years until an hour ago. I smoked between 1.5-2.5 packets a day.
I have trying to quit for quite some time now and have been failing miserably. Smoking something that I hate for so long and the constant failures have given me depression and tanked my self confidence. It’s not that I enjoy smoking, in fact, with every passing day I hate it more. 
This depression has impacted other areas of my life: my career is going down hill because I can’t focus and have zero motivation, I have been out of touch with my  friends. I am trying to spend less and less time with girlfriend, I have stopped working out and I don’t know if it really is because of failing to quit smoking but that’s the only plausible culprit in my mind. 

I am making one last attempt at quitting smoking, if I fail I will make peace with this addiction and accept what it entails. But I have promised myself I won’t go down without a fight. I have always failed not because of crazy compulsion but because I convince myself that one more won’t hurt. Now I am thinking if cigarette is really as bad as I make it out to be, then I shouldn’t even try one more.

I could care less about the potential health effects or honestly the enormous cost; it’s vaping toll on my mental health that’s made me want to quit for the past year or so. I have struggled with treatment-resistant depression, generalized anxiety, and OCD for most of my life. In the short-term hitting my vape alleviates symptoms, but the rush and relaxation of it becomes the center of my world. And, of course, being without nicotine for as short a time as 20 minutes causes all my mental health issues to begin to rear their heads.

I’ve put off actually quitting by reasoning that I should finally work out my other issues first, lest they get very intense during withdrawal. However, the vaping is so intermingled with my mental health woes that I think they’re unsolvable without taking away the nicotine addiction first.

Does anyone have similar experiences with mental health struggles and nicotine addiction? Any advice on how I should approach quitting?

Hello 

I desperately need your opinions on something I have been struggling with. 

I am a non-smoker and my girlfriend is a smoker. She has been smoking 10 cigarettes a day for about 15 years. 

After months of dating we have decided to move forward with our relationship and introduce each other to family, as her family is visiting town in November. I told her I was not okay with her being a smoker when we spoke about this and she immediately agreed she wanted to quit. 

For her first attempt, we did a “sober July” on which she quit cigarettes cold turkey, and we both quit drinking for the entire month. It was tough for her, especially the first week or so. I did notice she seemed a bit less energetic and a bit more lethargic. I tried my best to fill in our free time with healthy activities like hiking and going for walks and remained supportive and upbeat. 

She fell off the wagon in September during a particularly tough month at work and has been smoking ever since. She called her doctor and got prescribed Chantix, but there is currently a Chantix recall, meaning that is not an option right now. 

She talks about wanting to quit before November when her family comes but I am struggling to see how. Without the Chantix I am nervous about her falling off the boat, as the first few weeks of nicotine withdrawal are insanely tough. Additionally, it seems like her triggers are coffee, drinking, and stress. She is not a heavy drinker so we both have decided to avoid bars as much as possible. With that being said, coffee goes hand in hand with cigarettes and she once spoke about getting her caffeine intake in another fashion. However, she is talking about buying a new coffee maker which is a bit confusing to me. I’m nervous as I don’t see her quitting while she continues to drink coffee. 

I have suggested exercise as a replacement, but she does not seem too eager to take that on right now. 

I don’t feel comfortable moving forward with the relationship if she continues to smoke. We have talked about this issue and she knows the cigarettes need to go, but I am struggling to see how when Chantix is not available, there is a new coffee maker in the house, and exercise is not a priority. I’m not trying to tell her what to do, but I do not feel comfortable getting serious with someone who smokes regularly. Should I have another conversation about this? Should I trust her to quit and just be supportive? What would help us both be on the same page here?

I am unfamiliar with nicotine addiction so any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all!

What helped me quit:

Well first of all, some person on this sub wrote a comment about a quiz to see if you are ready to quit on this app QuitSure. I downloaded the app to take this quiz and well, guess I was ready because 10 days later I smoked my last cigarette. So thanks random commenter, you and this creepy app literally saved my life. 

Seriously I can not recommend QuitSure enough and no, I'm not here for promo. It's free. It works. I've had few to no cravings since I quit, though a few fleeting urges especially the first few days. 
 
Other things that helped: flexible working hours so I could get up and run around the block/do yoga/meditate as needed. My jump rope was crucial the first week. I stopped coffee for 2 weeks and switched to tea and yoga in the morning. The entire Sia discography got me through some rough moments - I swear every Sia song is about quitting smoking. And CBD - the first 4 days I smoked 1 or 2 CBD cigarettes and I still smoke it with some weed as I used to roll joints with tobacco. Yes, the weed has helped too. 

Also I have been alone this entire time - we are moving and my spouse is already in the new house while I stay to pack and finish work. The isolation has been helpful as no triggers (spouse still smokes) and when I was going through the bowels of hell known as Day 3 no one was here to make me even crankier. 

The changes I've noticed:
First week - insane brain fog, I was completely useless but other than that felt super empowered and confident with myself. Worked out basically all day - yoga, pilates, running, jump rope. Got some quit zits. Had no appetite so just ate fruit and nuts and olives and juice amd digestion was PK.  

Week 2 - super constipated which wasn't so much of an issue week 1. Got some depression but I'm bipolar so was expecting much worse (mood has been pretty hypomanic otherwise, but honestly I think the hypo helped me quit).  Then came the hemmerhoids and eczema. My gums and lips got super sore and started cracking and swelling. Body got warmer which is weird but I'm less cold now. Skim started glowing. Exercise and breathing much easier. Hacking up brown stuff too but was actually pretty satisfying.

Week 3 - still constipated, laxatives for breakfast every day. Started coffee again but still no alcohol. Mood stable and can run 10 minutes now! Eczema going away but some blood when I blow my nose. Lips and gums way better. Concentration slowly returning...and feeling proud AF. 


The best for me was QuitSure, exercise, and CBD as needed. I'll probably bring the CBD with me to parties as drinking is when I usually cave. It also really helped with relaxation and sleep. 

I hope I'm able to help someone on this sub quit as one of you did for me.

No vivid dreams since then, but my sleep habits have definitely changed. I used to be a \*very\* deep sleeper. Since I kicked the habit, I go to bed very early, and wake up at fucking 6am.

Please excuse any formatting issues, while I am not new to lurking here, I am to posting.

So, ten years of smoking. Started off in college while drinking - always bumming smokes and never buying any (super annoying to all the smokers out there, yes).  After college...bigger jobs, bigger relationships, bigger problems...more smoking.

I have had the opportunity to work all over the world with my career and also the honour of paying the wildly different waccy tabbacy prices along the way. Didn't matter if it was $5 in California (10 years ago?) or $30 in Adelaide (not so long ago....), I always paid. Im now in Canada and dutifully shell out $18 - at least 3/4 times a week- before to the nice lady at the Chevron down the street. 

Now let talk about the lighters. THE LIGHTERS. Im sure Ive spent $1000 on shitty bic lighters of all colours in my in lifetime. Half of which my washing machine ate and the other half of which can no longer be accounted for. Gone forever. RIP.

SO, 7 days, 12 hours and 35 minutes without a shitty cig at this point.

First 5 years - cigarettes, 5th-7th year - vape with occasional cigs, past year - glo. Averaging at around 15 cigs per day. I'm male, 28 and have an addictive personality.

It's been over 3 days and it goes paradoxically fine. No urges, no cravings, no nothing. Granted, I was eating a lot this weekend, was figuratively raping my fridge all the day long like there is no tomorrow.
Also, I feel that my temper has been shortened a lot, every single thing around triggers some primal rage in me and I believe I have some problems concentrating while doing some work.

But with all of that I feel a lot of energy, confidence, motivation and sometimes pure euphoria that outweighs the negatives.
And the most important thing is that deep inside I honestly don't feel the need for the cig. I mean I do realize that nicotine will lift some of those withdrawal symptoms but somehow I don't even feel the need to rationalize that smoking a cig will be only temporal solution. I genuinely don't feel the need for the nicotine.

What's interesting, I've already tried quitting. In contrast to the story above, I went cold turkey for half a year about 3 years ago. First two weeks were pure hell, every night getting myself to sleep was a challenge, I was not just sweating, I was melting in my bed, with my hands shaking, and for every damn second my mind was occupied with the one and only thought - ""I cannot do this any longer, I have to find some cigs.""

For some reason, second attempt is going much smoother. Maybe, that's because I mostly switched from cigs to vape/glo, but I felt no discomfort upon switching, had no withdrawals. So at that time I assumed vape/glo won't help me with quitting as the nicotine intake remained the same.

I also had several trips on acid in which I had a thought that's it's time to stop smoking. Well, not just a thought, a complete serious internal conversation, how pretentious wouldn't that sound. There are some cases you can find in the internet where LSD made a huge impact in battling addiction, mostly alcohol. Maybe it worked for me either.

It never works. I wish I could stop. I'm so angry at myself. I have mental health issues and that makes it even more difficult.

I used to cold turkey right?
Sorry just learned the words..

Maybe you will see my last post, I relapsed, than collapsed after 24 days free, and even not thinking about a cigarette once. 
After and meanwhile I read the book by Allen Car.

Since this collapse, I can’t stop smoking and f*****g enjoy it, and think about the next cigarette all the time!!!
I’m really a sport guy, Gym, running, tennis,soccer, surfing etc
And I just played 3 hours of soccer (with breaks of course) and my fitness level got much better in this 24 days, it’s not that all of the time it’s dont, bet it got much better.
I had so much more time and I was so much relaxed.. 

I feel like every cigarette I smoke is in the excuse of I will read the book again, or will stop in any moment..

I don’t know what to do!!!!!
And what to think
And what to feel..

I’m sharing, leaving it here online I don’t know what can you write, what surprises I will see

Thanks a lot for your time 🤍

TLDR- after a collapse of really enjoyable time free, I can’t get out of it again.

We all are aware of the setbacks of smoking, but that does not make it easier for anyone to quit it. People often try to quit smoking but are unable to manage! If you are one of those people, then don’t lose hope. Look back on your past behavior and think what steps you are going to take this time.  


**Tips To Quit Smoking**   
Are you ready to give up on your habit? Follow these tips to help yourself quit smoking for good:  


**Find Your Motivation**  
In order to succeed, you need powerful reasons to quit. Take a paper and write down the reasons you can think of to quit. Choosing the right reasons can decrease your urge to light up the cigarette.  
**Make a Plan**  
Smoking is an addiction that you can not quit without making a plan. You feel withdrawal symptoms that will make you crave a drag. Ask your doctor to prescribe you medicines or suggest a counseling session to help you with the journey.  


**Avoid Your Trigger**  
Think of the things or situations that trigger your smoking habit and try your best to avoid them. It might be a party or hanging out with certain friends; try to find your escape route. If such situations trigger your habit, then try leaving the place for 1 minute.  


**Practice Relaxation Techniques**  
Quitting smoking is not easy; you have to go through the stress that makes it hard to stop. For this, you can practice various relaxation techniques. When the craving hits, you take a deep breath and take a journey in your mind.  


[**Free stop smoking clinic Streatham**](https://www.pearlchemistgroup.co.uk/services/stop-smoking/) can help you take off your stress by practicing mindfulness that can help you cope with your craving and depression.   
**Key Takeaway**

Today is my 11th day and the farts tend to be around the evening and my belly is still bloated, I've been making a point of exercising for 45minutes minimum everyday for the last 2 days and plan on keeping at it to prevent unnecessary weight gain; I've also started eating more plant based now since I have more money to spend on healthier options. 

I'm a bit puzzled as to how I am having large bowel movements twice a day, every day. No constipation at all and I'm not eating more.

Around the same time I also went back to eating whole food plant based. Without getting on a soap-box, I eat plants with as little processing as possible, high starch, high fiber, low fat and low salt, no refined oils or sugars. I think this has **REALLY** helped me a quit, and here's why:

° This way of eating gets you hydrated -- eating meat and meat by-products will dehydrate you, not to mention all the salt. Water helps flush out residual nicotine and supports **ALL** those  bodily systems smoking has punished all these years -- plus, staying hydrated just makes you feel better overall

° The standard American diet is full of oils, sodium and sugar that (yes, will dehydrate you,  but also!) push your dopamine receptors like they were buttons on a game controller, which will ignite your cigarette cravings. Eating this way doesn't give you that same sensation and, for me, seemed to help abate the intensity of the post-meal craving.   
(Side-note: devious nicotine addiction 'knows' that our bodies' digestive absorption rates sky rocket post-meal, allowing more of the cigarette to be absorbed quicker -- supposedly, one after meal cigarette is worse than smoking 10 cigarettes).

° Finally, it'll help the healing process while giving you confidence.  Eating this way gives your body a ton of nutrient dense foods rather than calorie dense foods, so your body gets what it needs (helping it heal). And honestly, it'd be really hard to gain weight while eating this way. In fact my first week I lost five pounds just eating potatoes, rice, veggies, fruit, and beans. That really gave me a nice confidence boost during the times I was feeling weak or just down on myself. 

Even if you don't change your whole diet, I would bet just eating more veggies and fruits and less meat and fats would really help you deal with the first few weeks of stopping. 

I hope this helps! Good luck and stick to the stop!",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127595,public,self,Maybe a Helpful Trick: Eat More Vegetables,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/prmfiy/maybe_a_helpful_trick_eat_more_vegetables/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(For those of you who don't know what snus is, It's like american dip, only way stronger nicotine levels) And I've tried quitting 3 times this year and I finally snapped this weekend. I couldn't take it anymore.    


I've made it 3 months free using a combination of chantix and nicotine-free snus, or using a piece of ginger under my lips to get the burning sensation. I also used heavy painkillers the first week to up my dopamine levels which helped a lot with cravings, although I am not endorsing recreational drug use, I have a pescription for back pain. Also, quitting at a time when I had low stress levels in my life helped a lot.  


If you want to know made me cave in, then continue reading. It might help some of you fellow quitters to get some perspective maybe.   


So here's the thing, I recently moved to a new place to study. On a remote island in the middle of nowhere, I don't know anyone here, there is basicaly no one in my age group at the school, so I don't socialize much. There's nothing to do besides the usual A4 life, a lot of dead air, waiting for the bus and other boredoms. I've also been in quarantine for 10 days because I got Covid, and to make the isolation even worse I'm not even allowed a pet where I live. So hello Marlboro my old friend, I've come to talk to you again...  


The boredom and isolation isn't the only thing that triggered me, It's also the fact that the irritability that comes from withdrawal never seems to go away for me, and the only thing that calms my anger is nicotine. So I just went and bought a six pack and a pack of cigarettes this Friday, because I snapped at a student and a teacher, and I figured it can't be like this. If this is how it's supposed to be then what's the point of quitting at all? snapping at people and and having a burning rage that lasts for months... nah...

My best advice is to keep trying and don't give up no matter how many times you ""fail"" at quitting. I switched from buying packs to rolling my own sometime late last year, and I threw away my rolling supplies upwards of 5 times before I quit for good; and I don't regret it. I might have wasted a lot of money re-buying the rolling supplies when I caved, but it worked as extra incentive to kick the habit because after the 3rd time it's impossible to ignore how absurd this addiction yo-yo is. 

Be kind to yourself, even when you mess up. Note all the little signs of progress, including the way you're thinking about smoking and quitting. A lot of the time, the way you're mentally framing smoking and quitting is more important. 

The biggest thing for me was just accepting I was going to be more miserable for a while. And that's hard to accept when life is a struggle already. But just going in knowing that quitting is going to lead to moodiness, headaches, stress, brain fog, and tiredness helped me to handle all those things. 

Initially, I was so *scared* of the effects of quitting that I didn't want to try it. But once I just embraced the idea, like ""yeah I am just going to be less-than-peak for a couple weeks,"" things got a lot better. It meant my expectations for myself in any given situation needed to be different while I was quitting. I couldn't expect myself to be at 100% during the withdrawl period, so I didn't. I went to work and gave it everything I had...considering my brain felt like it was buried under 10 layers of cotton. I napped a *lot* because sleeping was just better than being awake. I went for a lot of walks because aerobic exercise helped with the stress and the headaches. When I ate fast food as a coping mechanism I didn't beat myself up over it, just took time to notice how upset it made my stomach and acknowledged it really only added to my list of general ills.

Overall I just tried to be really kind to my body. That was hard for me, as obviously smoking is quite *unkind* to the body and I had to confront and acknowledge just how much I'd been physically harming myself with smoking, as well as realize that for various reasons I personally struggle with being kind to myself. So that was something I needed to learn, and a mental muscle I needed to exercise. Just a normal level of decency to ones own flesh--what does that look like? What do I want that to look like? How does that *feel*, in my body? 

I treated quitting as a physiological and psychological process with actionable steps and obtainable goals. I studied the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal and mentally prepared for the effects and their timelines. I used an app that tracked what my blood and lungs and heart were experiencing without cigarettes (quittracker, but there's tons of others). Knowing the science-facts about what was happening to me physiologically helped reassure me that no matter what I was experiencing in my head, this was normal as a reaction to quitting and I needed to keep it in perspective that it wasn't a permanent change to my experience of existing. 


I didn't titrate down or use assistance drugs or slowly taper my use; I just quit cold turkey over and over again until it stuck, and in the meantime I tried to work on habits of kindness towards myself--both in my thinking and in my behavior. As I exercised my self-kindness/compassion muscles, I was more readily able to face the symptoms of withdrawl and grind through the 2 weeks of symptoms and 4 weeks of habit building necessary to enforce a lasting change. 

So to anyone else working to quit, good luck and be kind to yourself. It's hard and you deserve compassion no matter what part of the journey you're at.

At first to catch a buzz with friends.  Within a year, I was at nearly a pack a day.  Eventually I got to a little over a pack a day and continued that way through my wife giving birth to 3 kids, and for the next 21 years of my life.  Eventually reached the point where I smoked more years of my life than not.  
In 2012 I tried quitting using Chantix.  Luckily it was covered under my insurance.  It seemed to do a decent enough job but gave me the weirdest dreams and some awful nightmares.  I never fully quit while taking Chantix and stopped taking it, which lead me to smoking full force again.  
At this point, it was more troublesome.  I didn't smoke in the car with my kids, so a car ride was something like this; Smoke just before getting the the car.  If the trip was under an hour, I would smoke as soon as we got to where we were going.  If it was longer, i would take a smoke break about every hour.  This left me smelling of smoke sometimes and making my wife car-sick from the smell and the motion of driving.  
It got to the point where I was concerned about cancer and what my future would be like and wondering if my kids would pick up the habit.  I tried to quit a couple more times without telling anyone, so that if I failed, only I would know.    
My buddy quit and went to vaping.  He tried to get me to vape, and that lasted maybe a couple months, but I still smoked actual cigarettes.  It didn't help me.  
One day, in June of 2013, I had just left Bo'Jangles for lunch.  As any smoker knows, you have to have a smoke right after eating.  As soon as I got in my truck, I fired up the after lunch cigarette.  I immediately got a headache and as I was sitting there, I could see the nicotine stains across my windshield from the glare of the sun.  I asked myself, ""Why am I still doing this?""  
I took my cigarette, my pack, my lighter and tossed them all in the trash can.  I drove home, tossed my remaining carton in the trash, told my wife I was done smoking.  I went on FaceBook and announced that I was quitting.  That way I would be held accountable.  
The next 2-3 months were rough.  I kept trying to convince myself to just get one last pack.  Smoke one last cigarette.    
I started slicing carrots and celery and putting them in baggies to much on when the impulse to smoke came on.  People often don't think about the 'hand-to-mouth' motion being habitual and a hard thing to drop.  So people often lead to excessive snacking as a coping mechanism.  
I made smoking my enemy this time.  Looked at is as an entity that was trying to kill me.  I hated it.  After about a year, the smell would turn my stomach.  I could smell the person in front of me at a stop light if they were smoking.  Going into stores where an employee had just gotten back from a smoke break.  That smell.  It was nauseating.   
For nearly 2 years I kept having dreams that I smoked or bought a pack and fired one up.  I would wake up angry thinking it really happened, then sigh in relief that it was just a dream.  
It has now been 8.5 years.  I have officially been a non-smoker longer than a smoker again.  I have been alive for 43 years and smoked only 21 of them.  It was oddly depressing to know that for about 7 years, I was a smoker longer than I was not.  Now, that has been reversed.  
My buddy who quit smoking by vaping, is still vaping.  After all these years.  Vaping as much as he did 8 years ago.  I am proud to say I haven't cracked.  Not even once.  Not even a puff, since I quit on June 12th, 2013.  
It's possible.  I'm not a man of great feats.  I have no super powers.  I am as average as they come.  If I can do it, I think you can do it.  It's hard.  It takes determination.  It is well worth it in the long run.  
I'm saving over $5 a day, which I've put toward a hobby.  I'm not passing down a terrible, life-altering habit to my kids.  My wife likes kissing me again (she never smoked).  I don't smell like an ashtray anymore.  My fingertips aren't yellow with nicotine stains anymore.

Really seeking some advice here. I've been a heavy tobacco smoker for roughly six years (I'm 25 now), and only in the past 7 weeks have I been exclusively on the vape (strength 18mg, chain-vaping all day). After deciding to give that one up a few days ago, the symptoms have been nothing short of debilitating...

Aside from the obvious discomfort, the main point of contention is these crazy mood swings I've never experienced before, and insomnia. I honestly hadn't cried in close to 10 years, until yesterday. Full on tears, blubbering, runny nose.  

I cannot for the life of me sleep. I am utterly restless and feel as though I'm always on the verge of tears. I'm crazy emotional right now and want to know when, or if, the mist should begin to clear. 

Really hoping that this isn't going to be my default state of mind from now on, because if it is and smoking was just suppressing these emotions, I would rather go back on them to be honest.

I need a reason to trudge on and I'm struggling to find one.

I quit all my other vices FIRST this time because usually me needing a substitute for smoking would cause all kinds of bad behaviour or replacements.

So this time I’m quitting and just coping through the withdrawal.

Now I can’t sleep though. I have a ton of energy, acid reflux, I’m feeling pain everywhere in my body…

The cigarette withdrawal has never been this bad before, maybe because I’d usually drink while quitting IDK.

I also feel emotional but also alive. I feel all sweaty and shaky on the outside and my skin is oily…but I also feel clean and energized which seems paradoxical because I also feel exhausted.

Rollercoaster!

I just hope this levels out sooner rather than later.

This time I’m also taking tons of vitamins and supplements as well as an acid reducer because I always get GERD when I’m quitting and I’m taking probiotics too because quitting normally gives me the runs for some reason.

I am sucking on nicotine lozenges as well but in moderation and I have to keep spitting them out anyway because they start to make me feel sick after about 5 minutes of sucking on them.

One thing that helped me was to name the various feelings, discomforts, and urges because what can be named can be understood. 

It helped to classify the different experiences into three camps: withdraws, cravings, suggestions. So, when I'd feel physical pressure in my head after a meal and my subconscious mind would push ""cigarette"" through my brain, I could dissect each different, smaller part and deal with them individually rather than as some monolithic monster.

For the last few days, the withdraws are mild,  cravings are getting more and more sparse, and the suggestions are inconsistent and weak.

However! Yesterday and today I've noticed a different kind of prompt, and I wonder if ya'll have had it too. This is clearly under the suggestion classification, but it's not overt. I find myself feeling like something is missing, something is not present and I feel incomplete. 

So, I have coffee but I'm not satisfied with it because it lacks something that leaves me feeling not-whole. The same with eating, driving, etc.

I notice it most when I'm not in the moment: when I'm just mindlessly consuming my coffee one giant slurp at a time. I'm going to try to be more mindful, to find the 'new things""  about my drinks, meals,  etc that smoking deprived me of noticing in order to combat this subtle suggestion that is disrupting my peace.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on my second read of Allen Carr's Easyway. I read it about 4 or 5 years ago and loved it, it really made me rethink my relationship with cigarettes. In fact, I don't think I've ever truly ""enjoyed"" a cigarette since then, but I never stopped smoking, not even for a day.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm reading it now through a more adult lens, I came across this paragraph:

&amp;#x200B;

 ""Ask  a smoker who believes he smokes only because he enjoys the taste and smell of tobacco,  'If you cannot get your normal brand of cigarette and can only obtain a brand you find  distasteful, do you stop smoking?' No way. A smoker will smoke old rope rather than  abstain, and it doesn't matter if you switch to roll- ups, mentholated cigarettes, cigars or a  pipe; to begin with they taste awful but if you persevere you will learn to like them. Smokers will  even try to keep smoking during colds, flu, sore throats, bronchitis and emphysema.  ""

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm realizing that, no matter how much I've thought about the nicotine addiction and brainwashing, and actually AGREE with all of that, I NEVER have those thoughts or attitude when the craving hits. No matter how strongly I believe in that, and how I'm craving to be free from this shit forever, and I know the smell and taste and feeling are downright disgusting, I always end up lighting up another cigarette. This would be more ""excusable"" if it happened in social settings, but no. I can't go more than an hour without smoking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I run out of tobacco and it all becomes very clear: I just need to NOT buy more. I won't smoke if I don't have them readily available, I feel better already now that I don't HAVE to smoke another one. While I'm losing myself in these thoughts, some part of my brain (nicotine addiction) is already driving me to the store. 

&amp;#x200B;

How. The. Hell. Does. Anyone. Do. This. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the nicotine withdrawal itself is ""mild"", according to the book, then that leaves me with the psychological part of addiction. It is so strong, my tolerance for frustration is so low, that I can't even imagine myself without smoking, it's my crutch for everything, particularly boredom and stress. I fully understand what the book says about this, smoking to relieve anxiety is a paradox. However, these argumentos have little to no effect the moment the thought of smoking pops in my mind.

Hey guys. I have been smoking since I was 13, I am 18 now. In December 2019 I quit smoking and moved to snus, nicotine pouch. I hated myself for continuing the worst path; however, my craving was too strong. I always told myself when I move to Canada, I will quit as there is no snus here. I came to Canada and wasted what I had left of snus. I was ready. The first day without snus I got huge cravings and I was feeling sick. I tried to distract myself by smoking weed but it only made it worse. I became emotional and hysterical. I could not stop crying and having suicidal thoughts. Not having any friends in Canada did not help so I turned to the one thing I finally got rid of, cigarettes. I bought a pack and told myself it would be my last. It has been 6 days since I said that, I have smoked 5 and a half packs ever since. I need help, I fucking need it. What do I do? I am scared. I do not want to ruin my life and I do not want to smoke any more. I thought I was strong enough, it turns out I am a weak coward. 

I am not only addicted to the nicotine but to the fact that it was always my escape.

Me again. Former pack-a-day smoker. Managed to quit for somewhere around 50 days in 2019, blew it on some stupid nonsense, but I'm ready this time. I'm ready for real. I've been excited for every leg down in nicotine. 

I'm pacing myself to give myself the best chance I can, but I refuse to fail. 

But now at 1.5mg vape juice, I'm at the bottom of the ladder. From here it's one small step for man, a giant leap for not dying of preventable disease. 

It's weird how it all works out, but a few weeks ago I saw a meme on here from a guy who said he got lung cancer and it clicked again for me that I've been playing with fire. 

I'm ready to be done with this, I'm ready to stop romaniticizing smoking and making it a part of my personality. I'm going to hit 0mg, throw the vape away, hit the exercise bike and turn this shit around.

i was sitting there with a friend of mine, convinced i wouldnt get myself a beer, thinking to myself what the fuck am i doing here:

Im young, in university, friends are around and places are opening up again.

and im here, the most boring person at the location, judging people for having fun.

one beer led to another and irresitable cravings took over me and i got myself a cigarette from someone. 

and another one.

and we lit up a hookah.

it was so much fun being back with friends. this evening was so much needed.

all good i thought. not a big deal. i treated myself once. i have deserved this.

a friend of mine invited me for the next day to go drinking.
hell yeah i thought. i was craving social connection so badly.

humans need social connection. i dont think its healthy to life in total abstinence. always 'husteling'

would have been real fucking valuable for me to hustle on because of so much wasted time in my teens due to some problemes and a huge problem with substance absue.

i was on such a successful way.

but this is still not the point were it got problematic again.

the next day comes around. met with my friend and a few others. drank some beery some harder stuff and my smoking totally escalated that night.

asked one stranger after the other for a cigarette. anybody i could find to ask. didnt even look them in the eyes anymore only on there hands if their holding one.

still this isnt the point where it got problematic.

what really got problematic is that i crossed the barrier of lighting my hookah up at my place every possible second while at home ever since.

its even at that point again where i think to myself that i dont want it, i get headaches, my lungs hurt and i dont get shit done but my stupid addicted brain only needs like 5 minutes to change its mind and i prepare another head.

so...

i feel bad. not too bad bit i know what im doing is not good at all.

i think the biggest problem is that i dont hate i enough to see the bad side of it yet.

nicotine addiction got its grip back on me in less than 2 days.

i know what it feels like. the mental aspect of not wanting it but still doing it and the physical sensation of nicotine withdrawl.

its back

tomorrow im back awake, and my mind is gonna trick me into consuming again.

i know none of your comments will stop me from doing so. only i can stop myself.

the reason i consume is because i cant stand be be left alone with my thoughts when i know theres something more pleasurable whitch distracts me from my pain.

but i will embrace the pain. i love pain.

pain makes a man

i pushes me forward to new hights.

to reach impossible achievements and no fucking stupid useless substance is gonna stop me from doing so.

i want more from live than numbing pain with substances and being chained to my addiction.

i got a new therapist with whom i hopefully be able to work with successfully.

as much as i wish luck to myself i do wish it for you.

this is gonna be hard again but i will overfome this annoying sensation of withdrawl.

mostly need to work on how to connect with other young people without consuming. but its everywhere and im so fucking lonely and unhappy about how hard it is to spend time with other young people and not consume any kind of substance. feel like im missing out of so much fun only to realise the night out was totally annoying and not fun and i have to spend a whole day hungover and a full week tired and waste time and so on. i want to build value now i harvest my compound interest achievements in the future. hopefully i will be able to do so.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127530,public,self,Hey guys ✌🏻 i started smoking again and i fucking hate it,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pqd6hf/hey_guys_i_started_smoking_again_and_i_fucking/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First 2 weeks were a hell of a ride for me, but I made a huge path in these 3 weeks in a matter of dealing with my own emotions and I feel good now.

Because nicotine is a drug. It's weak, but if you always smoke its effect is permanent. You are in a constant clouded state of mind, you do have distinct emotions, but cigarettes blur them in one big goo. That's why I smoked, actually. I had a lot of negative feelings and emotions that I wanted to blur, I wanted to literally smoke (make less vivid) them.

But if you always smoke you can't deal with them and make they go through, you just try to hide them, so they always stay there, making your life worse, always keeping your level of psychological stress at a pretty high point. Cigarettes just help you to have a constant emotional constipation. I wasn't ready to deal with myself sober even 6 months ago, but now I realize that it's way better to stay sober. I just don't like that clouded head space no more. It takes time for your psyche to learn to process sober emotions, but it's worth it.

The first month was rough and I was irritable and anxious all the time, made it feel like I wouldn't get past it. But as time went on it did get easier for some time, even past the 6 month streak I was pretty amazed with myself and surprised that I had made it that long. Around a month ago I started struggling with anxiety on a more regular basis. I lost my job in July and I started taking some online classes a couple weeks ago but during that period between not working and not occupying my time with anything I started to feel the urge to go back to smoking really bad. I've struggled with bouts of anxiety before and usually when I did, the cigarettes were always there for me. Being a smoker for 10+ years they felt like they became a part of my identity. It always felt like a crutch that could ground me and bring me back to reality when I was having excessive worry or intrusive thoughts. Dealing with my anxiety this time around has been more sobering and difficult because I now always have the thought in my mind that I should just go buy a pack and start smoking, to see if that helps. There's other things I find myself doing that I didn't feel necessary when I started quitting like chewing more gum or putting a toothpick in my mouth. Sometimes I'll just go out on the porch and pretend like I'm smoking but just get some air instead. I'll even act like I'm holding a cigarette sometimes. It's weird to think about how engrained that behavior of smoking became even though it's been almost a year since I had one, it's just lately I've been doing a lot of reminiscing on the times I was a smoker. I know it's a big illusion that the addiction created but it really feels like a part of me is gone with the cigarettes out of my life. Anyway, just wanted to rant about this for a bit and see if anyone had any similar thoughts or experiences to share.

I've seen too many people on oxygen in the hospital because they have COPD and will spend the last years of their lives unable to breathe properly, until they finally die an hypoxia related death. I've seen too many lung cancer patients coughing up blood and moaning in pain as they die a slow and painful death. I've seen to much judgement in the eyes of my fellow employees as they walk by me sucking down cigarettes, too many people have looked at me like I'm some sort of scum for doing it. I'm done letting this chemical have any sort of hold over me. I'm tired of feeling like a crazy person when I don't get a cigarette in every four hours. 

I've been smoke free, cold turkey for about 6.5 days now. I already feel like I can breathe better. I can taste food and coffee again. I can smell my own farts again. So far the biggest symptom has been that I feel less in control of my emotions. Maybe this is how I felt before I started smoking, and I was using nicotine to treat that in a way. I don't remember. Regardless, I am glad that my meds have enabled me to do this with minimal physical withdrawal symptoms after the first two days, besides my inability to sleep.

I'm also proud of myself, especially after today. I had to drive for 3+ hours today, and every part of me wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes before I left my home town. I found myself trying to rationalize it. ""Well, maybe I can make a rule where I only smoke when I have a long car trip, "" ""I'll throw the pack away when I get home""  but luckily I stopped myself. Instead, I bought a pack of gum. I don't know why I'm posting this, mostly to share my success. I'm just proud of myself, I guess, and I want others on this sub who haven't quit yet and are looking for motivation to know that you can do this.

In the evening I watch series on my laptop and browse the web but the very first thing on my mind when I wake up is thinking about smoking one and of course I need to smoke at least 2 or 3 before I go to bed. 

This has become so weird and I sure know how addiction feels like as I'm deep down into one. I tell myself every night before going to sleep that I'll quit the next day or at least reduce the number of cigarettes smoked but when I wake up the urge is strong. I'm tired of it and on the other hand I'm somehow used to being addicted and not doing anything all day but thinking about smoking and smoking. I could spend all day just listening to music while having a cigarette. 

Sometimes my teeth hurt and when I wake up in the morning or during the night to go to bathroom ( I'm 22 and I have the urge to pee almost every night or morning , might be because of cigarettes but I'm not sure ) sometimes I cough. Sometimes my ribs hurt.

Buying a pack, smoking two or three, then throwing the pack and the lighter away. Going off the advice of Allen Carr, I was determined to just rip out that nicotine drip. But I kept coming back.

This might work for some people. But what I realised after trying and failing literally maybe 20 times was that I was sick of the *sensation* of smoking but not the nicotine. The need for a nicotine was the only thing bringing me back.

So I finally dropped a load of money (up-front) on a full course of nicotine patches plus gum. I thought of it as an investment that would save me so much money in the long run if it works.

I'm now five days in and haven't *once* wanted to smoke. Yesterday I even took the patch off for about 12 hours and still didn't want to smoke. Once the familiar 'pinched' feeling came (again, for a *nicotine* hit, not for smoke in my lungs), I slapped on another patch. The thought of smoking made me feel physically sick.

Here's my point: it's easy to think you're strong enough to quit cold turkey. I kept kidding myself that I could tackle both the psychological and physical addiction at once. But actually I needed to get used to a smoke-free life.

I'm already feeling the benefits. I can breathe better. I smell good. I can smell *things* (it was actually kind of an emotional, Proustian moment to walk into a supermarket on day 3 and actually *smell* the fruit and veg aisle). There are no longer dark rings under my eyes. I have more time. I'm happier. 

Without the nicotine cravings I can see the cigarettes for what they actually are - a filthy transmission method for a highly addictive substance.

Even if I'm still popping nicotine gum in the months, even years ahead, it's a much better option than actively poisoning myself. The reason that NRT is twice as effective is because it allows you to tackle the addiction by degrees. For all the good that the cold turkey method is supposed to do, I feel like the all-or-nothing approach isn't for everyone. Like any big problem, it can help to take it in smaller bites.

Ideally I would have liked to put this post in the ADHD subreddit, but quite likely it will get removed there as there is a policy against suggesting alternative treatments. 
Also, I remember reading somewhere that there is a strong correlation with people who have ADHD and picking up smoking.

Some info about myself
I'm in my early 30s
I was diagnosed with ADHD early this year

While I have struggled with ADHD throughout my life, I did not have a proper diagnosis and could not receive a proper treatment.

Before the diagnosis - I would use alcohol everyday to shut off my brain immediately after work. I would also occasionally smoke cigarettes as they help me relax and focus. I intentionally avoided depending on cigarettes for the fear of getting addicted.


I was prescribed adderall, and initially I took it for 2 weeks. It helped a lot with focus and concentration, but I felt it blunted my emotions, and affected my sleep.

I thought at this point that perhaps I should just use tobacco since cigarette were so much more effective for me. 

However, genetic research I found that there are alternative ways to get tobacco that are not nearly as addictive.

That's how I came across the nicotine patch. After experimenting with the dose a bit, I settled on using a quarter of the 14 mg patch every day. I would put it on the first thing in the morning and take it off before going to bed.

I found myself much more comfortable with the nicotine patch than I did with adderall or without any medications. I also do not have any urge to smoke cigarette or drink alcohol to shut down my brain in the evenings.

That is a clear improvement in my impulsivity and my mind is much more relaxed and focused.

The only downside I have seen is that I feel so relaxed and comfortable that I don't have much of a motivation or ambition. I'm not sure but this could just be my mind experiencing calmness for the first time - rather than a lack of ambition. Comparing to my mind in non-medicated ADHD state, back then I always wanted to do 100 things at the same time. Not having the same constant urge to do everything that catches my fancy, it may be 'ambition' lost for the better.

I have been using the nicotine patch for 2 months now, and don't see myself going back. I've also tried experimenting not using the patch after every few days - and I can immediately see my mind if much less focused and impulsive when that happens.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127481,public,self,Nicotine patch for ADHD,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ppazkd/nicotine_patch_for_adhd/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now I'm that annoying person who says *If I can do it, anyone can.*  


If you've tried quitting you probably already know a lot of these thing but they don't click or you don't care. We know it's bad. It can kill us (don't care). It's a drain on finances (so what). Here's one you already know but don't fully appreciate the extent of it yet.

You stink. I mean you really F'n stink. That ashtray you have outside that you wash very rarely. That's is how you smell to others all the time. Even now I occasionally get a slight whiff coming from my carpets despite never having smoked inside and having deep cleaned them repeatedly. I feel physically sick when I do. Brushing your teeth constantly and spraying perfume and deodorant work no more than they do in a toilet. Now you just smell stupid. Once you are smoke free, you will immediately think back to all those non-smoker friends/family/partners/exes and wonder how they tolerated it. You stink so much more than you realise.   


&amp;#x200B;

You'll watch Youtube videos and read posts like these in forums and get that spurt of motivation which then dwindles.  You want to quit but it seems too hard or you really can't be bothered. If you're like I was, you're probably smoking as you read this.  When I say put it out, ditch your smokes and become a non smoker right now, you might want to but probably won't but it's really as simple as that.  You're a non smoker until you smoke again. There's no such thing as ""quitting"" or  ""cutting down"".  
You have everything you need to quit right now. There is no easier time or date or setting. Stopping right now is the biggest advantage you can give yourself as it is about doing new things and breaking your old habits. Quitting later is your old habit and this is the first thing you need to change. Stop deluding yourself and clinging onto things you think will make it easier as they only make it harder.

Don't set a time to start quitting, don't cut down, don't try weaning yourself off with gum and patches. It's the slow bandaid but it does work for some, however, a little statistic based on *my* own experience and people *I* personally know is that 100% of those people who relapsed after quitting were on gum/patches/nic vape and 100% of those who have successfully quit never touched them and also changed their surroundings to help break their habits. 

Quitting isn't about stopping an addiction, it's mostly about breaking a habit which has slowly changed you without you realising it.  You need to reclaim and retrain your brain. Nicotine is completely out your system in around five days or so and no matter what you think your body is telling you, you no longer have a physical addiction. You don't *need* it, you just think you do. The more you feel like you want to smoke and the stronger the urge, the closer you actually are of being completely free of it. It's the nictone death thrall. When you're getting closer to being free of it, it's the nicotine itself **not** the lack of nicotine that makes you feel crap without it in order for it to survive in your body. Once you understand this, it's easy to push through the urges as it's a sign that you are succeeding not a sign that you're dependant on it.  

You probably already know this too. Maybe you have quit and are a few days or weeks in, so here is something else I've said before to people -  changing the things you see every day help just as much, sometimes more, as changing what you do every day.  It's not just about taking a new route to work, or trying a different supermarket or taking up new habits like exercise or drinking water.   


Something as simple as changing your phone wallpaper is a good start. Don't go back to one you liked before, get something new, something different. Perhaps try something you don't particularly like as you need to get yourself out of your old mould. 

Rearrange your furniture! Change your curtains! Use a new dining set, rearrange the pictures you may have on display around the home, reverse your bedroom layout and change your quilt covers. Rearrange or replace your fridge magnets, listen to music you would never listen to, buy a brand of food you usually don't buy, stop at that shop you pass by every day, buy a new mop, switch which drawer your clothes are in or better yet, do a big cleanout... No matter how small it is, no matter how trivial even if it's something you don't realise you notice, somewhere deep down in the recesses of your mind, you have noticed it and this little change goes towards rewiring your mind.   


Look at how much it costs you to smoke per week, then look at something that costs the same. If you were thinking of taking up a new hobby, now is the time to start as you can afford it. Put your money towards your new passion.   Just like your stench, you probably don't realise how much money you are burning. When I quit, for the first few weeks/months I would use my ""smoking money"" to reward myself with something new each week. Sometimes saving up a few weeks and getting something big. I would start buying new things to slowly replace what I already had so I was seeing new things every day which changed my mentality and attitude. Got a new kettle, okay, I'll try a new brand of coffee, new coffee? Okay, new mug. One little thing opens up the path for another little thing. It snowballs. 

One day I was driving to the local shop for full cream milk for one of the seven coffees a day I was making with my new kettle, the next thing I was walking there and buying light milk purely because it has a different label to the one I was used to seeing (these little things really do help) to make one of the two coffees a day I now drank. I went from two teaspoons of sugar to half a teaspoon and I wasn't even trying to cut down or be healthy as it just happened once I started to change little things I saw every day around my home. It *all* snowballs.

However, there's also the health thing we all know about. I knew but I didn't care.  I developed lung problems six months after I quit. Who knows, I might yet develop cancer down the track but at least I don't have these problems while still trying to quit while burning money. It was actually the money that drove me to quit and it was having new things and fresh scenery that kept me off it. I only really struggled the first five days but it was nothing like it had been the 3464315 attempts beforehand. This time it was different as I just stopped and saw nicotine as the little bastard it is. I also hated being a slave to my smoking schedule and also the stigma of having society now ranking me below junkies as they are ""victims"" and smokers are apparently just ""selfish c\*nts"".  It's not true and I still empathise with smokers, but I was no longer going to give my money to tobacco companies and even more to the government so I could stand in an alleyway on my smoke break while paedos, rapists and non-smokers looked down on me for hiding myself away and minding my own business.

I had intended to cut down and set a start time. 31st jan 2018, but on the 27th as I was halfway through the cigarette I would have before brushing my teeth before bed and something in my head said  ""stop clinging to shit you think makes it easier as shortcuts now are long paths later"". 

Wanting to sleep but having to smoke first for what reason? Brushing my teeth many times a day because of smokes. Spraying deodorant to ""hide"" the unhideable. Having to go outside in the cold to smoke.  Automatically deducting smoke money from my paycheck before food and bills. Why was everything to my smoking schedule? Why did every single photo of myself have me with a cigarette? I put it out and as disgusting as it sounds, I actually still have that half bitch wrapped up. I immediately threw all my smokes out and in the following days I gave all my lighters and ashtrays away.

That next morning I craved a smoke. I pulled out the wrapped half smoke and took a whiff and felt sick. Then I pulled out all the crap from my cupboards and drawers and decided to just do what I had always put off. Out with the old.  I changed my ringtone. I changed my desktop wallpaper. I thew out all the old crap in the freezer, I rearranged furniture. All the things I mentioned and it was this stuff that made it easier. Seeing different things every day whilst still in my familiar environment was the kick I needed.  I would donate things I still used and needed in order to force myself to have to get new ones or at least replace them with different ones. I'd deliberately put myself in situations where I would have to walk or take the stairs instead of drive and take lifts and I started drinking water despite NEVER drinking water. Really, before my only intake was through coffee.  


Changing your environment and the little things you see, do and use every day is what will break your habit which is what quitting is all about. It's all mental after the first week. Ditch your smokes right now. If you already have, go make a huge mess in your bedroom forcing you to do a deep clean. If it's clean, then go attack that junk drawer or shed. Anything no matter how small. Rearrange things in your home, move your lamps around, put your spoons where your forks are and your forks where your knives are. Rearrange any artwork or posters or even replace them and rearrange what's on your shelves, change the radio station in your car, eat somwhere different for lunch, go online and look for a penpal or message a complete stranger, grab a random book you know nothing about and start reading even if you don't read. You can do the same things but do them differently, you can live the same life but in a fresh environment.

 Just imagine you are in a web and you need to move as randomly as possible to get out of it. It doesn't need to be all at once, but you need to change more than just stopping your smoking as in hindsight you will see how much your smoking has changed your life and habits bit by bit without you realising it so you need to do more than just stopping smoking and trying to tackle the sum of those changes in one go. Start reversing that and get off of cigarettes schedule and create your own. 

Obviously exercise is one thing that comes up and I know it's not an option for everyone, so just walk. No excuse unless you're in a wheelchair in which case, just roll. Already jog or roll? Reverse your run path. 

You'll make things much easier for yourself in the long run by making them harder in the beginning but don't forget to reward yourself (just don't do it with food, especially sugar as it goes hand in hand with nicotine.)  You'll soon forget you are trying to quit as you will be adjusting to these new habits and changes while the other little things like the new morning alarm ringtone and that horrible incense you started using even though you hate incense start going to work on you without you realising it.

Changing things about yourself also changes how other people are towards you or what you talk about which in turn changes how you are. Try new shampoo. Get a new keyring. Go to the pet store and buy the ugliest goldifish they have that nobody else will want and give it a home. Change change change and new habits.

I started keeping the bottle caps from bottles of water for some unkown reason. next thing I knew I had hundreds of them. Ended up giving them to kindergartens for arts and crafts and still do it. Feel free to develop temporary quirks or lean into existing ones.

One last thing. I used to think I smoked more when stressed and it helped to relieve it and that seems to be the general consensus among smokers. However, I've found it to be the opposite and I now see that studies have found the exact same thing. Smoking does not reduce stress in the way we think it does. Taking that break you take to have the smoke and breathing along with the temporary dopamine hit does, but that's part of why we smoked in the first place. It's all mind games but it's not until you are free of it all that you can see to what extent it all controls you. I think back to chainsmoking when stressed and only ever feeling better temporarily which is a big difference from now as now I stress like normal people but am free to actually tackle issues and not smell while doing it.

  
I know it's a long rant and I've probably repeated a lot as i just started typing without looking back, but I'll leave it as is. I only hope that even just one person will flick that switch in their head and realise that you really do have everything you need to quit right this very minute. So stop with the excuses and stop waiting for the ""right time"" as that is all your enslaved mind talking. I was the same and as I said, I am now that annoying person who says *If I can do it, anyone can* and that really is an understatement. I was such a smoke addict that there are still friends and family who don't truly believe I've quit like it's some ongoing prank. Ditch the bitches and go out and buy yourself the ugliest toothbrush you can find. It's something you see every day and will have a greater impact than buying one you like.   


Good luck, unless you are still putting it off in which case, stop undermining yourself. You probably don't like it when other people mistreat you or make you do things you don't want to do, yet here you are doing it to yourself.

I used to smoke consistently for about 13-14 years. The past 2 years were probably the worst I was moving from a pack a day towards a pack and a few in the past year. A long depression created a downwards smoking spiral 6 years ago, where I was having sleepless nights and I would grab my headphones and smoke 5-10 cigs in a sitting outside until I was tired enough to go to bed, and with lockdowns and wfh for a year and a half now it only got worse.

The past months I finally had enough, I was feeling it was  bad for me, every morning I knew I couldn't continue like it. I gave my cats food, grab a drink and straight back out to smoke a cigarette, sometimes I made it 3-4 hours but Everytime I caved. This week I faced I couldn't do it cold turkey, I needed help. So I bought 2 weeks worth of patches and some nrt mints for sudden cravings. I felt shame I had to admit I couldn't do it without. My mom used to smoke, she used the patches and I had the occasional streak of not smoking and she said something along the terms of you better not need patches to quit, you are 25... It haunted me for years I could do it myself how could I be so addicted, and each time I failed within a few days the past months even hours. 

But right now marks end of day 2 without touching a cigarette, it feels great. It hasn't been without challenge but I truly feel I don't need them anymore. I put the first one on and it took 5 hours for me to walk to my balcony as an involuntary movement to smoke when I realized, I don't really want one, its just a habit. The first day I made it through with one additional mint in the evening when the craving for worse I felt the craving, used the mint and it went away. Now day 2 and I made it through without a mint, not because i set myself up to not use them, just the craving wasn't there. I have had the occasional craving, at traditional smoking moments for me, before I start making dinner, after I finished dinner, when I stretch my legs after sitting down for an hour, but all in all they are slowly getting less noticeable through the day. The patches have a 10 week plan, 6 weeks 21mg patches, 2 weeks 14mg and 2 weeks 7mg. I feel I could go faster but I am not going to, I have tempted faith enough, and I am not tempting it again to save a few £'s. If this helps me quit it forever I'll happily pay for 10weeks worth of patches 90£ for 10 weeks, thats about 1 week of my old smoking habit, it's worth it, I am worth it!

I decided I was going to give up even occasional smoking for the highest quality of life possible, better lung power for the gym, no more stinking clothes or furniture, not spending $10 fucking dollars for smoking 3 cigs out of the pack and angrily throwing the entire pack away the next morning, etc etc. 

Anyway... feelin' damn good for the most part. Extremely cranky at certain points and accidentally snapped on a friend over text the other day and apologized. But other than that, I'm giving myself slack to give in to cravings for sweets, coffee, sleeping in, being distracted, etc. I have a great therapist I see weekly. Welbutrin and Adderall both decrease my cravings for tobacco pretty significantly.

I, M 24, starting smoking at age 18. I didn't know until then there exist different brands or type of ciggarettes. 
First ciggarette was smoked with a friend after school when going to home. It was unpleasant and I didn't feel good tbh but after one day or two then I again smoked not because I liked it but kinda looking cool. Then again now without a day break. Initially thought this isn't addiction  just to show off but it goes on. Started smoking 2-3 cigarettes for a day till 1year . Then started  smoking (approx)10 ciggarettes a day for the next 1 year. 
Later next year I joined college and I was feeling great because now I can smoke in my room as I moved to my hostel far from my home. 
Started smoking weed in 1st year of college initially joint or roll but this started getting real and ciggarettes go to around 20 maybe a day. First two year of college went smooth as nothing is hitting hard in studies and kinda get   average grades. I was good in athletics until high school but started smoking my breathes keeps getting shorter and in college I tried to fit in schedule I left every sport because of smoking ( breathing issues) 
I started feeling slow and heavy because a bit worry and ciggarette. 
3rd year I finally trying not to smoke or if I do only 1-2 max but failed nearly everyday for six month. Nothing worked a bit. Used videos on YouTube and read blogs but practically I break every vow made to myself. Every week I said this will be last and 3rd day I smoke. 
Then comes my final year in college it was a disaster as company(firms) start recruiting from my college then I face backlash at every point starting from not good academics, no extracurricular, body posture not great and stamina. Every time I feel a bit less,  ciggarette was there to provide support (I feel at that time). 
So my last semester, I started having pain in my heart but  ignored ( should never do ever). Then feel if I don't quit this time then it would be lethal and tried again but again failed for 2-3 times. It was March last year then lockdown I came home but with hope that I never smoke again and damn it was somehow worked this time. For straight 2 months strict lockdown no shops open though I have tried to get ciggarette but thankfully failed every time for two months. After that I am at home working online (got job in a online interview ) and no ciggarettes till now. 

Things that may have worked for me but could help you - 

1. Mindset : You have to say that I can and you will. In my case I failed many times but finally done it. Do tell youself every time you smoke that this is not good ( I know it is hard) 

2. Avoid triggers : find which triggers you and remove that part with something else. Eg. Mine was when I was exhaust doing something with mind ... For this I break the concentration for sometime drink water and then back and other trigger when I saw smoking or near smoke. 

3. Friends and emotional support: very important but not worked well for me. My friends helped but they aren't quitting and majority of time I failed because of my friends because when I see them I get trigger. I have sacrificed but it pays back now. My friends tried to morally support me but no help there. I made distance a bit to my friends ( this was painful) but we are good. 

4. Exercise and food : They are useful but mind don't want that. I made excuse to me it is ok ( I am young I didn't need and....). They will work only if you by slowly day by day.  Starting slowly but consistent. Remember this has practically worked for me and not from some article. Each day is important . Each day. 

5. Stretching: I separate it from exercise because you don't need go for explicitly streteching. You can do it anywhere. Neck stretching is games changer. When feel to smoke stretch 

5. Alcohol and weed increases amount of ciggarettes

These are main factors but small bits also helped as this post is pretty lengthy now itself so if you want ask anything feel free. 

I know there are smokers for about lifetime and don't have any major problem but remember everyone is different and their genetics. 
Smoking help you think is my most apologetic excuse to smoke again but in long run it will not help I assure ( as much I have experienced) 
Stay healthy and quit today (because tomorrow....)

My problem is that if I don't smoke for a long time, I start eating everything. I'm sure that I'm not the only one with such a problem.

 Recently, my friend gave me a good idea- to buy a Juul. My friend has been smoking Juul for quite a long time, and every time I forget my cigarettes (and this happens quite often), I take the device and make a couple of puffs. By the way, ironically, I gave him a Juul to stop smoking cigarettes. So, it happened that now he belongs to a group of people who like to smoke delicious liquid and exhale pleasantly smelling smoke. 

I think smoking Juul is much more convenient than cigarettes since I can take a liquid containing Cannabis or other delicious additives. I read that the liquids for vape/Juul have cannabidiol, and cannabidiol is a drug contained in plants from the genus of hemp. It increases the heart rate, excites the body, and relaxes the nervous system. It's precisely the effect I want to experience after smoking.

Vaping actually help me with it. I went from 2 packs a day to getting the highest nic juice and started going down from there.

However, I realized one thing after that. I never experience relapse. Somehow vaping ease it out for me like how you would slowly quit smoking from 1 pack to a few sticks a day.

I still get that urge now and then to smoke of course. On the first year of quitting, seeing people smoke made me go a bit crazy but I held on. Now, I'm happy to say that I'm free of it. It's like I was back to those days when I was young when I see people smoking and hate the damn odor and stay the hell away from it while wondering why do people smoke.

I persevered on my own and made the decision to quit myself. No one pushed me, my family never new I smoke until I told them a month after I stopped.

I just wanted to back to the days that I am the one in control of myself and not anything and anyone else. Now it's been 3 years but I'll stop counting. Forget it about it all and not say ""I stopped smoking"" to ""I don't smoke""

Hello there kind buddies, 

After smoking a pack daily since 2012, one wonders what your body can do when you quit smoking. I quit about 3 weeks ago and have never ever felt so good. Although I have some mountaineering experience and I run a mile or two every few days, I never could push myself to anywhere near the level of my fellow hikers or athletes. 

But today, am elated to mention that I competed this workout in about 2 hours or so. My LADY friend , who always use to beat me in all sports , today got to see my fitness abloom. Honestly she have had making fun of me for time immemorial. But I guess not anymore 🤼

It is just remarkable what your body can do when you quit smoking in just 3 weeks. Apple Watch Health data indicates 5 to 10 % improvements in VO 2 , SpO 2 and so on. 


For those of you still struggling , also consider how much YOUR health shall be beefed up. 

“Probably , you will never ever go back to smoking when you have observed how much your athletic abilities have increased. “ 

You all made this possible, thank you so much.

As the post title says, I have been smoke free for 6-weeks.  Up until the end of July I was smoking heavily before starting my quit with the level 2 patch.  I did sneak one cigarette after a week, so I reset my quit date, but have not smoked since then.  Once I ran out of the patches, I switched to the 4mg mini lozenge, which I preferred, since it allowed me to experience the withdrawals and satisfy some of the ritualistic parts of smoking.  I only used about 4-6 lozenges per day as opposed to smoking an entire pack.

I allowed myself to run out of all nicotine products a little over 3 weeks ago and have been nicotine free since then.  Those final 72 hours were not that bad.  Some anxiety and restlessness, but I was in a situation that allowed me to literally avoid people the entire time, so my external triggers were very limited.  While I did have a little too much time to overthink, there was no way for me to obtain any cigarettes or nicotine products, so I had to just deal with it.

Now I do have access to smoking, but also a solid support network and commitment to staying smoke and nicotine free.  I have been able to drink alcohol and be around other smokers without relapsing.  I have had cravings, and will continue to for a time, but I feel confident in my ability to stay smoke free.

I have been reading Alan Carr’s book, though surprisingly I haven’t finished it yet.  I plan to, but haven’t needed to lean on it as much as I expected.  I’m just happy to be this far along.  It is possible, even if you relapsed after many years, like I did.

It used to be a pack a day back when he was in college but now that he's 25, he only smoke 1 to 2 a day. 

When we first started dating, I didn't think much of it. I've dated smokers before. I guess there was just a small part of me that was worried about his health but meh, our relationship wasn't that serious yet so I didn't mind it. 

(I'm now a first year med student and I hear all the horror stories about smoking and the shit it does to people's lungs so I AM AFRAID.) 

We are very serious about each other now. We want to raise our own kids, we want to grow old together. I can't help but think about the fact that there's a HIIIGH chance I'll lose him early cause of how much he has smoked in the past and how much he will smoke as he continues. It doesn't help that he's 5 years older than me so it just adds up (cause older means ??? idk) 

I've wanted to bring this up for a while but I'm unsure as to how to bring it up with him. He still seems healthy so I can't use a medical condition as an excuse. 

Do smokers find it disrespectful when their SOs ask them to stop smoking? I'm just afraid he'd want to break up with me cause I haven't said anything about it for 2 years and suddenly I'm bringing it up?? 

Help me please. Any thoughts are appreciated.

So I quit smoking July 14th of 2020.  But about 2 months later, dealt with something that shook me and resulted in me smoking about a half pack in two hours or so.  I realized I made a big mistake and threw the rest out.  That was the last time I smoked which was about a year ago (don't remember exact date).  I've quit several times in the past (2ish months max) where a fuck-up would almost guarantee me becoming a smoker again.

It was extremely important that I did not psychologically ""start over"" or ""start from scratch"" because of the relapse because:

1. It's inaccurate.  I had been quit for two months and was used to being a non-smoker.  If I started smoking again, I would be starting over as a smoker.  Staying quit would be me continuing being a non smoker.  Additionally, I hadn't built up the physical addiction, nor patters of a smoker even if I smoked a half pack.  I did not re-pavlov-dog myself.
2. If my attitude had been that I had ""thrown it all away"", I would be more down in the dumps, and more likely to say ""might has well have another since I'm starting over anyway"".  The important thing is you don't have another, and not undo all your work you've done by becoming a smoker again.

I (23M) have once again decided to break these shackles of addiction. I first started smoking when I was 18 and have been smoking close to 2 packs a day for the past years. I have been trying to quit for around 6 months now, failing everyday.  My longest quit lasted 3 days. After close to 50 failed attempts I decided to give myself a 2 week smoking pass and then put out my final one 40 minutes ago. 

I want to quit because I spend way too much time on smoking (close to 4 days a month according to my app). This affects my ability to work, even when I am working and not smoking all I can think about is my next smoke. I tend to take a break every 30-45 minutes for a smoke, so as you can imagine I can barely get anything done. As the frequency of my smoking increased I started feeling very tired, came down from working out 4-5 days a week to probably 1-2 times a month. 

All these constant failures in quitting smoking have taken a huge toll at my self esteem. From being a very confident guy I have now become someone who's scared of taking up even the simplest of challenges. I have decided I can't live like this. This needs to change, my life needs to change. I want to focused, confident and fit again.

I am working alongside Swedish Match to try and overturn the illogical ban on Snus in the UK. I am sure you don't need me to tell you about its relative benefits compared to smoking, and the remarkable success it has had in Norway and Sweden as a smoking alternative. If you doubt any of the above, I would be happy to try and change your mind.

I am looking for UK based Snus users who would be willing to contact their MP, and help us with our campaign. If anyone is interested if only to find out more information about what we are doing or the benefits of snus as compared to smoking, please feel free to email me at [darius@abzed.com](mailto:darius@abzed.com), or comment below.

I have the problem that I am also smoking in my apartment. Remaining concentrated during home office is one big difficulty that I need to overcome. Additionally I want to finish writing my phd thesis. Some might argue that it is not the best time to quit, however, I don't enjoy smoking at all anymore. I feel with every cigarette that I am just doing this because of the craving.

I can go for hours without cig if I do something physically somewhat active. However in front of the monitor and the meetings I have the urge to smoke basically almost all the time. 

Additionally I developed unhealthy eating habits in the last year because I often smoke instead of eat and probably also subconsciously use the cigs for blood sugar control and my cigarettes have increased from ~15 up to sometimes ~23 in the last months. 

Moreover I have thyroid issues and the recovery of the thyroid function in the first three months is at least at parts responsible for what we experience as withdrawal. Cigs interfere with thyroid function in many different ways.

I also get blisters on the lips, brain fog, heavy PMS, very emotionally unstable, panic attacks, when quitting for some weeks

All this makes it a bit difficult for me to quit, while I still need to perform well enough every day. 

I tackled a lot of my health issues with supplements and diet, and I would like to go the next step to break free from this addiction. I really do not want to continue smoking because in the long run the negative effects definitely outweigh the shortterm avoidance of a difficult withdrawal and I can't stand the smell of the smoke everywhere anymore. It is disgusting. 

I came across this talk by Dr. Andrew Pipe
https://youtu.be/8nUDS9g46Uc

and he explains very well how NRT need to be individually adjusted on order to be beneficial for individual people, by first dosing high enough and then second decrease the dose in little steps. So I will give this a try. I will not quit immediately, but use the NRT to first reduce the amount of cigarettes daily, once I have found a more or less stable dose with the patches, I will replace single cigarettes with gum, whenever possible. 

I had some old patches still at home, way over their shelf life, but I thought worst case they are inefficient and I tried them since they weekend. Since they are 5mg only I observed when I would return to the frequency of approximately one every 50 minutes and noted that this is the case after approximately 4-5 hours, then I use a new 5 mg patch.

Let's say that until now I can say that the urges have drastically decreased and I feel a kind of peace and inner relaxation that I did not have for a very long time.

I am writing this OP as kind of a documentation of my own path for all of those that are interested in the approach and are in a similar difficult situation.

I am nit going to argue the quit once and for all approach. I tried for years, had weeks without cigarettes and it always affected my daily performance in a way that was actually intolerable.

Maybe I am too weak or the complexity of the other issues makes it too difficult for me. The once and for all approach did not work for me and this is exactly the argument Piper makes in his talk. If something didn't work several times, then maybe it is times to try something different.

Best wishes to all of you.

I’ve been having a few symptoms of quitting smoking - needing to clear throat, croaky voice, coughing by up phlegm (although nowhere near as much as at the start).

I didn’t think much of it until I checked my smoke free app this morning and to my amazement I’ve been smoke free for the best part of a year and a half! I couldn’t quite believe how long it’s been and I don’t even miss the little bastards one bit! 

It feels like when I first quit and my lungs were clearing out just not as bad, but I didn’t expect it to start again this long after quitting. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this? I am going to have a chat with my GP just to put my mind at rest but just wondered if anyone else had any similar experiences? Is there anything that you did that helped?

It's not easy, in my family many people have died from cancer and there are still many people who still smoke, it seems that the plug doesn't fall on my conscience and makes me have a willpower to overcome this addiction.

This has affected my life in many ways, I am single, without friends, without purpose in life. Just waking up, working, exercising and doing it all on autopilot . I know I need to change and act soon, because the disease of alcoholism is going to get worse. But every week my brain tortures me saying it's okay if I go out and have a few beers, I know I'll never drink small amounts, the word moderation doesn't exist in my vocabulary.

Do I need to wait for the worst to happen and hit rock bottom? I do not think so! My decision comes from now, and I would like to follow it through the next few months and see how my life will change. It's a lonely process and since I don't have friends anymore, I'll have to trust myself, have the necessary willpower and do what needs to be done to keep a sober life, this is my wish.

Not only that, but I’ve noticed I don’t eat when I’m stressed anymore (think I may have some kind of eating disorder). It makes me feel better about myself even though I know vaping might have more serious consequences. It’s something I’ve been working on, but I think Ive only replaced one problem/addiction with a worse one. 

I’ve tried to quit vaping twice to no avail, and I unintentionally go to vape after so many hours without. It’s like I get a craving and there’s no in-between stage of realizing, “oh, I’m getting a craving”, so I just get up and go. I don’t know how to be more conscious of that in-between moment. If I don’t vape I get mood swings and nausea. If I do I only get a headache, but feel better mentally (obviously, that’s what an addiction *is*).

Essentially, I’m asking for advice. How do I quit by myself or get help outside of parents/guardians? I have big plans for myself, and nic addiction is the last thing I need holding me back. I would never forgive myself.

This is a little vent from which I need reassurance, tough love and common sense. Perhaps at the end some concrete tips. First though, the part you skip if you're a fan of tl;dr:


I stopped smoking on the 12 of April 2021. It was a fantastic choice. I didn't want to be a 25-year-old smoker and to an extent, I have been successful.


For nearly five months I just didn't smoke. The first 3 or 4 weeks were a bit of a ball-ache, but I could push through. I had reduced my daily smoking heavily in the build-up and was averaging 2-3 cigarettes daily before the quit; as a result the withdrawal symptoms were (I imagine) quite mild. I ate a bit more, gained some weight and then carried on.


Imagine the pride I felt! 8 years of smoking cigarettes and not wanting to and finally I had fingers firmly hooked into my bootstraps, pulling me to where I wanted to be. It was good and I had stopped thinking about it, apart from brief cravings of a few seconds. These served more as a reminder that I used to smoke than a reason to begin again.


So imagine my dismay today, realising that I am back on track to making one of the most stupid decisions of my lifetime -- AGAIN!


I MEAN WHAT SORT OF FUCKING IMBECILE MANAGES TO KICK THESE BASTARDING DEATH STICKS AND-


But anger towards myself won't help much, I believe. I am a flawed human and flawed humans don't respond well to emotional criticism.


I was with a girl. I like this girl. This girl smoked.
This girl introduced me to friends of hers. They smoked. We sat outside in the grass at a music festival. They smoked. We wore black. We appreciated how good we have it, by lamenting how bad others did. We drank alcohol.


At some stage in the night, this girl lit a cigarette and a thousand details came together in my mind.
She looked sexy, it smelled good, we were giving the world a middle finger, because we weren't allowed to care about something as trivial as our bodies, when there was so much else happening.


I'll stop now, because I am aware that I am to an extent romanticising a nicotine high and addiction.
This is why I took the cigarette, though. I took two more that night.


I was aware that I did not want to smoke and I was aware that I had no physical urge to do so. I very simply just felt like it, hence my description above.


Last Wednesday and Thursday I smoked 4 more cigarettes, I think. I was at a training course for work and we drank in the evenings. 


I've seen too many of my friends in recent years go from people who only smoked at parties and bummed fags to regular smokers. None of them wanted to. They all thought they had it under control. For many it was a long, slow descent into dependency. I reckon my history with tobacco would arrange a speedier recession into addiction.


Here I am then, back with you beautiful people. Fuck this for a lark. It's not worth the pretty girls and collective nihilism. It's definitely not worth the yellow teeth and smelly clothes, standing in the cold with a blocked nose.


I cannot yet reset my quit date. I remain proud of the 12th of April. That was the day I began having more days without cigarettes in my life than with. But I crave accountability, too.


Does anyone have an all suggestion for me in which I can work in a relapse, take the relapse seriously, but not reset all the progress I made.


I have not damaged my lungs to the same extent I did over 8 years of smoking with these 7 cigarettes and I would like a smoking app or tool that reflects that.


Thanks for listening and I hope to see you below.

I realized that a lot of US culture just likes to make things sound hard and turn them into some kind of heroic quest.

I think it's just not true.. 

All I have to do is occupy myself for 10 minutes or 3 bad days or whatever at worst. After 3 days the nicotine is long gone, and the nicotine addiction is barely an itch, it's not some crazy monster like meth.

Then I started googling and found smoking has been linked with abdominal fat. Does anyone know if it's the nicotine that messes up my fat storage or can I continue vaping and quit cigarettes completely and expect abdominal fat loss?

I've been listening to Alan Carr's *Easy Way to Stop Smoking*, finished it and threw my pack and lighters away. I didn't do it because that's what's expected or asked, but because I knew at that point, **after almost 20 years of smoking**, I was no longer a smoker. 

I set my no smoke app timer, which for me doesn't so much represent how much time my willpower has held out as much as it represents how long I've been a non-smoker from that point on -- to commemoratethe transition. That was 11 hours ago. 

I of course still feel cravings (same strength as the ones that didn't wake me up from my 8 hours of ugly-sleep every night), I still feel light withdraws, and my subconscious still sends weak-sauce suggestions, but I don't have that brainwashed dialog wreckin' my day. I'm not feeling anxious or deprived.  I'm genuinely happy, I feel good and I have no desire to smoke ever again. 

So this afternoon, I got what I would have considered the **BIG** test during my previous quits: I went shopping and my car fob slid out my shorts' pocket and under the seat. I bent over and saw one camel blue short next to a green mini-bic lighter. The occasion only missed the slight scent of sulfur and a low demonic cackle to turn it into a cliche movie temptation. 

My first thought was -- damn, I'm really **not** a smoker anymore. I don't know how many of you have had the degrading experience of tearing aparr your car during a quit or just a day when you were gonna be out of smokes for awhile, hoping to find a pack with one cig left or a half-smoked cigarette in the ashtray, but I've had that humiliating experience. Many times. When I saw that camel blue and lighter, I realized I hadn't combed through my car this time. Hadn't even considered it. I then threw the cig and flick away without a problem. It wasn't even a temptation.

I have to emphasize: this has never been my experience before and I've tried to quit a *brazillion times*. I also want to recognize the percentage of smokes who read the book and don't find it easy the first time (keep up the tries, I believe in you). I also want to say, I know I'm just one cigarette away from falling back into the trap, being a smoker again and needing to stop.  Again. Relapse is the norm and should be a part of rehabilitation. 

But right now, I feel... like celebrating! I'm really happy!

But before long you’ll start rationalising smoking to yourself again, and because it’s been so long since you last smoked, you’ll have forgotten most of the negatives of it.

I had quit and started smoking again in past. since over a year I was trying to smoke. one day I just said F it, whatever cravings I get bring it on. I don't want to screw up my health anymore. 

so from March 1st week I stopped smoking, I would usually spend around 250 to 300 CAD per month. smoking a 25 sticks pack in 2 days. and 1 pack costs 15$ for pall mall blue.

to motivate myself I purchased a glass jar, I would put 100$ in it per week as a symbol of how much I didn't spend on smoking. 

the first week was the most difficult. I didn't get so much of physical cravings like stomach pain or headache. my symptoms were more like restlessness, couldn't sleep, uneasiness, I would get angry quite easily. but that was only for 1 week. and I was smoking for around 7 to 8 years. 

after the 1st week, things started to get good. my brain fog started to clear up. I never knew I had such a thing. I felt lightheaded, I could think clearly without getting angry. I just felt a big weight has been lifted away from me. so I started taking evening walks. before I never felt like walking or going out since my work is from home now. 

and from that initial 1 week of torture, after that everything is good. at times I would crave it while I'm watching movie and I see someone smoke, or while I was stressed. but I did not give up.

I was more curious to see how my body / mind felt when I'm off nicotine. because since 20 years old I am smoking everyday for 8 years now. cigarette had become such an everyday thing that I couldn't imagine life outside of it.

This is my three week update.  Here are my [introductory](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/), [one week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/), and [two week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pif0tx/two_week_update/) posts if you are interested in my journey, if not, this post should serve well as a stand-alone too. 

Unlike last week, I had zero things that could remotely resemble cravings. I'm free, it's over. For those of you thinking about quitting, or early on in, I think it needs to be emphasized how excellent it is to not be a smoker. I speak with a lot of people and share various experiences about a lot of topics, so although I haven't personally experienced every one of these things, I feel confident with the ones I have and the way the others have been described to me to say that all of these are in the ballpark of what it is like to be done with cigarettes. If you have done any of these things, feel free to add.  


Getting glasses, or even getting lasik. Either way, you can literally see the world in a way you never have before. No more being a slave to bad eyesight or pair of glasses/contacts. Every aspect of your daily life is instantly improved by the eye-sight you should have always had. Imagine living your life thinking your vision was fine only to discover that it is so much better. You'd be ecstatic.

Building an emergency fund. Or becoming debt free. Personally, I have never found an unexpected problem that $8000-$10000 doesn't fix. Of course, I don't have a family so my number could probably be lower than that, but I like the security. Point being, this is another thing that completely changes your life for the better. Car breaks? Unexpected bill? Covid Layoff, etc. It's amazing what this one feels like. There's no more money stress. I got this one out of the way early, but there was a time in my college days where I was so stressed about money than I would literally have dreams at night about still not having $2 to buy a coffee. Once I decided enough was enough, and put everything into saving cash for these problems, the problems stopped happening. 

Getting fit. Even just mildly. This is a good one too. I've never been fat personally, but I have been so out of shape that it was almost as bad. Getting off the couch, getting out of bed, just anything that involved any sort of voluntary movement seemed like such an inconvenience. After just a few sessions at the gym, and it doesn't matter what kind of workout you do, as long as it's *something* it will work*.* You'll get your life back and instead of making a face expressing that you want the asker to ensure that it is something important when asking you to get off your ass to do something simple, you'll leap at it because not only is it easy, but it is also fun to help someone. They wouldn't ask if they didn't need your help.

Getting out of jail (like I said, I talk to a lot of people with very unique experiences). Or escaping Poland in the Soviet ages. 

All of these things result in the same feeling, the freedom. The getting your life back. The Air smells good, the lighting is more vibrant, you want to jump for joy and you actually can! You're not trapped, and you realize that you never had to be. I'm sure there are countless others, and it's probably easier to just ask what the best moment or lifestyle adjustment you've ever made was, and tell you that smoking can't be topped, only matched. It's wonderful.

&amp;#x200B;

It's only been three weeks since I've had a smoke, or any form of nicotine, but it actually feels like a distant memory now. Not that I was a smoker, but the act of lighting one up and inhaling the smoke. Right now, that act seems so out of the question that it's hard to imagine actually doing. I guess that that is to be expected when I have not smoked the 509(!!!) cigarettes that I would have smoked over that amount of time. And yes, that is truly insane. 509 smokes. Never again.

One thing that I think Allen Carr understated, although still emphasized in his book was the relation to will power. He pointed out that it takes willpower to start smoking in the first place, and it was very easy to nod along to that. Not a single aspect of smoking is actually enjoyable until you're addicted to the nicotine, and yet we worked hard to get to that point. Why? I'm not sure, but anecdotally, I thought about every smoker I knew... It was just most of them, it was ALL of them who could be accurately described as *strong-willed* I can only speak for myself there, but I have a hunch that most people would draw a similar conclusion when thinking of the smokers they know. Maybe there's one or two out there somewhere who aren't headstrong, maybe.  


My Ferrari fund is now at over $330 after the three weeks. Mathematically, there's still no reason I won't be able to buy a supercar at some point in my life with this fund built with money saved from smoking. I'm going to love this, but already I find it hard to imagine that I will enjoy it more than being free from smoking. 

It's also amazing how little I go into gas stations. I think I may have actually been inside one once since my last smoke. Usually just pay at the pump, don't deal with those damn lottery ticket people, lines, etc. The smoke free app doesn't calculate the time saved from that into their models, but calling that 5-10 minutes per day doesn't seem unreasonable.  


Finally, today is the start of football. This is going to be interesting because NFL games have LOTS of time for smoking. I used to constantly smoke while watching football. Especially up here in Canada. See, we get Canadian commercials, and they're repetitive and terrible. We're get the good doctor, a virgin moblie, expedia, a truck commercial, and an NFL shop one during every single commercial break. Quite often, these commercials will play more that once in each break. The jingles in your head are so irritating after an hour that you have to mute the TV. This is also why I don't miss watching anything on The Paramount Network where their ads are all just clips of their own shows. Sometimes even while you're watching that exact show. 

That was an interesting post for my three week update, I came in without having a lot to say and rambled, hopefully it was at least entertaining. The truth is, it's hard to keep writing specifically about not smoking as it's become such a non-issue after three weeks. Once you kill your addiction (I called mine ""The Dirty Bastard"") by starving it to death via not letting it have what it wants, there isn't anything that would make you want to be a smoker. There just isn't. I'll never be a smoker again, and nothing about that seems uncomfortable... or even anything short of the best feeling there is. 

Thanks again for sticking along for the journey. If you have anything to add, please do so. I'll keep these posts up if I can, but some will turn into rambles like this.

Endless gratitude for the advice, support, and stories on this journey of self-improvement. This is my personal experience in case it can help someone along the way get through even one craving,  from a 10 year smoker and 5 year vaper

Wanting to Quit:
-felt so shameful/embarrassed about this habit. I was always ended up lying to friends, families, and coworkers to sneak out to get a fix. 
-awful migraines on the daily
-it’s expensive!! Living in NYC on a modest salary, I cut corners on almost everything but justify spending $20 every two days on nicotine. This is $300 a month. $3600 a year. I would bust my ass off at work for a $3.6k raise
-felt my mood was dependent on a drug

Quitting:
-I have many attempts of quitting smoking before, but don’t like to see them as “failed” attempts.That 25 day streak is still 25 days I didn’t smoke. Progress isn’t always linear. Some people can quit first time cold turkey and that’s incredible! But I am not one of those people. I try to look at it as if it’s a workout. I wouldn’t expect to get my goal mile time the first try, but that doesn’t mean that I am doomed and should give up. Please keep trying 
-the reason I always end up smoking again is because I can’t stand being irritable. I’m trying to identify my triggers and find replacement behaviors. Recognizing my weak moments makes me actively try harder in those times
-I end my quits by taking “ just one puff” which ALWAYS leads to the habit again. I either bum off a friend  or tell myself it’s ok to “treat myself” just this one time. You are lying to yourself. If you never make that micro-decision for one more puff, you won’t fall back into the trap. 

Resources:
-Allen Carr’s Easy Way. This is not a magic book I read and immediately found it easy to quit, nor do I use all his techniques, but am at least armed with the knowledge. Just get the book. You can sometimes find it at the library even. It is probably 5 hours of your life that you would’ve been on Reddit anyway. Main takeaway is that nicotine does nothing for you except bring a tiny bit of relief that nicotine caused in the first place (paradoxically the feeling a non-smoker has all the time)
-patches and nicotine lozenges. I’ve done the patch before and didn’t have intense cravings (and mostly even forgot about smoking after a week or so). This is the first time I’m doing two types - 14mg patch for a week, now at 7mg, and maybe two 2mg lozenges throughout the day. I haven’t had any really bad cravings! Even stepping down was fine, I was kind of moody for the day but nothing dramatic. Can update when I am completely free from NRT (sorry Allen Carr).
-workout. Do a YouTube workout, take a run, do some squats. Whatever works for you to exert your body somehow and get that sweet endorphin release
-SmokeFree app. Satisfying timers to keep track of your quit time, little daily missions, and things to scroll through while you have a craving helps a ton!
-journal. Write down your reasons, struggles, and benefits. This is really cathartic for me. 

All these things ($15 book, $50 NRT, $1/week SmokeFree app STILL cheaper than smoking)

I believe in you:

I started smoking when I was about 16 because I thought it was cool. Fast forward 30+ years and I have smoked well over 100,000 cigarettes. Well, that was stupid.

I successfully quit once when I had my first kid, I started again when I lost my second. Fast forward a few years and my kid isn't far from leaving home for university, I'm tired, my body aches even though I get lots of exercise, I worry about cardio vascular issues when I wake up with tingling hands, I'm single and smoking hinders my options and I'm not going to lie or try and hide the fact I stink, smoking is expensive and times are tough these days.

I'm getting and feeling old.

But I'm not giving in. I've spent the last few months losing weight, getting stronger, learning about all sorts of new stuff, getting better at my job, becoming more empathic and passionate. Nicotine is my last anchor and has been the majority cause for the remainder of my problems. It's made me sick and has been keeping my sick for decades.

By chance I stumbled upon the quitsure app (no affiliation and it's free) and for the first time I've been able to understand nicotine and be honest with myself about my smoking. Diving into the psychological side of nicotine addiction has made the step of quitting so much simpler. I've tried and failed with NRT, vaping, cold turkey, and reduction, all of which in hindsight seem like silly things to do now that I understand how nicotine works in my body and brain. I am now well equipped to spend the rest of my life as a non-smoker, in fact the though of a smoke disgusts me. I am free.

Here's to a better life for all of us.

What side effect I had been going through:

Bloating.
Vomiting.
Extreme stomach pain.
Dizziness.
Heart palpations.

I imagine this is happening because my body has became extremely dependent to nicotine. I don't know what to do.

I don't want to nicotine patches gums or any other physically coping solutions.

I really am reluctant to see a doctor about this. I just feel like I should be able to quit without having this much of a physical side effect apart from having cravings which I can deal with.

I would appreciate some advice from OG ex/non smokers in this subreddit.

He always agreed and said he thinks it’s nasty and I thought we were on the same page. Fast forward a few years and he starts hitting all of our friends vapes. Which I feel like isn’t as bad as cigs as far as the smell but obviously the addiction is still there and harmful. 

I asked him to quit a bunch of times because I was worried about his health and after like a year and a half he finally quits (I think) Turns out he just switched to cigs. And he was hiding it from me for about a month. I smelled it on him one day and kind of put the pieces together. I confronted him about it and he apologized profusely but at the same time he kind of didn’t want to stop smoking cigs. 

I was just very hurt that he lied to me and hid this very big thing thing from me as well. We got in a huge argument that lasted hours over the course of a few days and I basically told him for the millionth time that I can’t date someone who smokes cigs and that it’s a deal breaker. But for some reason that hurt him because he felt like we were bigger then that being an issue and told me I was only conditionally loving him. 

I don’t feel like i’m in the wrong at all because my position on it has never changed and will never change and Ive always made it SO clear to him . But he feels like I only love him on the condition he doesn’t smoke and now he feels like the way i view the relationship is different then the way he does. In the end of the argument I basically said that I obviously love him more than I care about the Cigs but I need him to quit and I just couldn’t stay together if he doesn’t. 

He told me this was kind of a good thing because he’s been wanting to quit anyways and this will just push him to. But it’s been a few weeks since then and now it’s starting to feel like he is resenting me a bit. He tells me about his grandpa that smoked until he was 90 and never had any health issues. 
My bf got these alt cigs with no tobacco just to help with the craving for the act of smoking and I asked him how it’s going and he just says it’s shitty and he feels like he wasn’t ready to quit. 

Now I think he just views me as controlling even though he lied to me and went out of his way to hide this thing because he knew how i felt about it and now he’s acting hurt that he’s not an exception to the rule? I feel like he is trying to quit but I do worry he still smoking but just doing a better job of hiding it. It feels harder to trust him i’m general now.

With smoking its like you feel as though you can only feel joy from smoking and everything else is better when smoking, but the sobering reality is that everything else is just passing the time and the only feeling of joy is from smoking when addicted. 

I know I have experienced joy in the past without smoking, but when going through cravings its like you forget or just can't even imagine feeling it anymore without. However because of that morning on the third day when gandalf appeared with the sunrise at the east...(jk, nerdy joke), I know I can feel joy without smoking and that the reality is every little thing will start to bring joy, but its still hard to imagine when going through serious cravings.

I guess writing this just helps, because I know even something like smelling fresh air in a forest would be 10000x more enjoyable when not addicted or even something dumb like macaroni on the stove, and other things like sex(even without a partner), which just feels like releasing an urge when addicted to smoking, and playing games and getting a good item which when smoking is just like ""well now I'll reward myself with a cigarette"", because the reality is any sense of joy(arguably a false sense) and reward relies on smoking when addicted.

Anyways, I was writing the post for help at first because I needed help because I lost that 3rd morning feeling and was struggling to imagine joy without smoking, leading me to consider smoking again, but logically I know on some level it will get better and the only thing I can do is keep going with no real concept of when I'll actually feel joy again.

Also coffee is arguably not helpful, its more of a high than a down like smoking and when really high you just want something to bring you down even more, but the habit of drinking it seems to help a bit. I've been trying to have tea more than coffee because just the habit of a hot bitter drink is nice(I feel like without sugar its actually more enjoyable because the sugar just feels like a poor smoking substitute).

Also having essential oils in a diffuser seems to help a bit, along with the smell it also makes the air more humid causing you to sweat out more nicotine. I've also been running every day/other day. I feel like the more I do to get through smoking the harder it is, but I also know its partially because everything I've been doing is making me get rid of the nicotine faster causing stronger cravings.

Now I'm just ranting though. If you're struggling just know you can experience joy without smoking even though its almost impossible to imagine when going through strong cravings. If you've had a brief moment of joy without then just hold on to that feeling. The reality is I haven't truly experienced joy in over 10 years from smoking/drugs and I know it could be years until I really experience it again, but it has to be better than this.

I'm honestly not usually this depressed, which makes you think ""well I laugh and what not when smoking"", but the reality is aside from those brief moments with family/friends, you're not fully experiencing joy because those hours and hours between those moments you could be enjoying yourself rather than passing the time and numbing your body just to feel rewarded from dumb things you do when you can just feel rewarded by the actually thing in itself instead of relying on a cigarette.

* My throat doesn't hurt anymore. One of the best benefits. My throat was always irritated and dry and in pain. I was addicted to cigarettes but my throat was miserable.
* I cough 80-90% less. Didn't cough a lot before, but it's still better.
* Just generally breathe so much better. And the smells become stronger. 
* I am generally out of shape so I do run out of breath easily, but this improved so much after I stopped smoking. Now I feel like I'm actually a little out of breath and not dying. 
* Might be unrelated and TMI but I have better bowel movements.
* Just feel better, not being tied to smoking. I am really happy I quit smoking. 

Tips:

* You need a strong motive and you need discipline. I thought I had a strong motive so I was baffled that I wasn't quitting already. Then kind of had a fit over the fact that I keep smoking and just quit. I was very frustrated that I couldn't quit. It helped.
* You don't have to set a date if it's not your thing. You can if you feel like it helps and I encourage you to, but you can also just say ""fuck it"" at 2 am on a Tuesday and it's going to work. 
* Keep your hands and mouth busy whenever you feel like you want a cigarette. I wouldn't recommend chips or such. Maybe gum or mints or candy that you can suck on. And allow yourself to eat what you want to a certain degree. Remember: it's very hard to diet and quit smoking so most specialists advise against it. You can return to the diet once the cravings stop and smoking is less of a problem. 
* Not gonna lie to you, the first three days are tough. You can't focus, you want to smoke, etc. The good thing is that you are stronger than your desire to smoke. It's one day. You can power through one day. And if you can power through that day, you can power through all the rest of them. 
* Only if you feel prepared: As soon as you're out of the crazy cravings period, you can try to expose yourself to triggers (drink coffee, drink alcohol, hang around with friends who smoke). In this way, over time, they will not present as triggers, or, at least, they won't be such big triggers. It's also fine if you avoid these triggers. Whatever keeps you smoke-free. 
* If you fail, try again. Keep this as a goal. Most ex-smokers failed at least once. Quitting is hard, but it is doable. It doesn't matter if you manage to do it the first time or the seventh time or whatever. As long as you manage to quit, it's worth it. 
* Do not tell people you quit unless you have to. Some people can be assholes when you're trying to quit and the things they say will not always be helpful. You just mind your journey and ignore those who talk big but don't appreciate or respect hard work. 
* If you need professional help, seek it. Smoking is as much of an addiction as any other addiction. It's okay to need help.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127269,public,self,Celebrate my 2 month smoke free anniversary on 9 September.

I have been smoking for about 5.5 years of my life. I’ve quit twice and relapsed just before 3 months both times. I’ve used cold turkey, Chantix, and nic gum and have not had much success. I wanted to ask if anyone has had luck with nicotine patches? I really want to quit but am having a hard time stopping. In the last few months I’ve become an uncontrollable chain smoker and I hate it. I’ll admit I’m becoming desperate. Even though I spend nearly 25% of my annual income on tobacco, that fact alone doesn’t combat with the urges and cravings. I feel so weak, like a failure. The patches feel like my only option at this point, and I was also hoping for some advice on how helpful or not helpful they may be. Any advice on the matter of initial quitting would be appreciated as well.

Sometimes when I smoked, I would feel that with the nicotine ""high"" would also come a sapping or draining of my energy. I was aware of it, but figured that the ""benefit"" I perceived from smoking outweighed that energy drain.

I was wrong. Not only was it a physical energy drain, it was a mental one too. My mind feels faster and I feel more free overall to do what I want because I don't have that nicotine stealing my energy.

I anticipated feeling better, but I wasn't anticipating this much of a difference. It's significant.

Backstory:  
Started smoking at 18. I'm 41 now. Active lifestyle—surfer for 30 years, rock climbing, spearfishing. Quit smoking because it was holding me back from higher physical performance.

It's 3:30 a.m., and this rude insane addiction just woke me up, screaming through my dreams into my subconscious, that it *needed* to be attended to. It wouldn't be ignored. The more I tried to suggest it away and go back to sleep, the larger it grew until it was a nightmarishly huge beast: a looming three-headed monster of insistent deep cravings, wide-spread withdraw symptoms and unrelenting mental suggestions. Anxiety gripped my body and took control of my voice,  ""This is terrible! I can't do this!"" I wailed to my partner. 

I don't have much a plan. I have some reasons to quit. I have people in my life who want me to quit. But right now, all of my will to quit is being snuffed out by the betrayer part of my mind, which is well-practiced in compiling with the beast's insidious suggestions, telling me why I could (why I SHOULD) have  just have one more cigarette (it'll take the edge off); buy just one emergency pack of cigarettes to get through the worst of the withdraw; I never really wanted to quit, I just needed to cut back; NoThInG iS wOrKiNg! 

I grabbed a cuttie, some ice water and this phone. I read my reasons to quit, my hourly success goals (despair: not even a full day yet -- how many times have I been here). I read some of you on this sub-reddit. 

I remembered: One cigarette doesn't make this feeling go away. One cigarette, my last cigarette, is the reason I feel this way. This is how it feels to be a smoker between their last puff and the next, and the only way not to feel like this is to not smoke one cigarette more. You can't feel satisfied as a smoker -- you can not crave as a non-smoker.

Withdraw is unpleasant -- I don't want to restart, prolong this

I do not want to be anxious, smelly, unhealthy, unable to take any job I want or go any where I please because I have to consider this beastly addiction first (before myself, my family, our well-being). I *WANT* to quit! 

This is working. Relief comes the longer I don't feed the last cigarette with another cigarette. By just not taking a drag, I'm slaying a dragon.

I tried to quit a couple of times, the most I managed was a year,after that just a few months, always relapsing,but lately I had been smoking like 5-6 cigs a day, tried to go without it like two days and I had very bad withdrawal and I couldn’t take it.

I didn't know what to do if I couldn't smoke my morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Morning cigarette. Only smokers will understand how important it is. Morning cigarette.

I was saved by very old(and also very lame) electric stove. It was looking just like black metal circle. And, lucky for me, this metal circle was heating up. But it was heating up so damn slowly. It took at least fifteen minutes before I could smoke from this stove.

So I quit smoking cigarettes on Sunday August 29th, 2021.  My last cigarette was on Saturday night, the night before.  I went 10 days without a cigarette and then decided to smoke just one cigarette.  The cigarette tasted so nasty and made my throat hurt.  

So I'm now back to no smoking cigarettes again.  I switched to oral smokeless tobacco (dip) and this is what has worked best for ME. 

I also have been using nicotine lozenges from time to time, but they just aren't as satisfying as the dip for ME. 

I am not encouraging anyone to use nicotine in any form, I am simply sharing that switching to using dip works well for me because I have less and less cravings for cigarettes as each day goes by.

In my opinion smokeless tobacco is a safer alternative than cigarettes.  I have read many reliable studies and research to back my opinion up.

-meditation 
-swimming and more importantly sauna 
-going for a walk 
-eating some fruit
-drinking coffe AND doing something physical right away (coffee and cigarettes used to be my favorites)
-slowly re reading THE BOOK

I'm having my wisdom teeth out in a month, and naturally they've told me I can't smoke for X amount of time before hand, and Y amount of time afterwards. Obviously, the first thing I did was Google ways to get around this warning, and the likelihood of the smoking having a negative impact on the surgery.

Quite frankly, it's idiotic that my brain is wired that way. What an insane idea.

I've been smoking for about 15 years. I tried to stop one, moving onto a vape for 8 months, then caved at a music festival (circa 2013).

I ENJOY smoking. I enjoy the taste, the smell, the feeling. I don't want to quit, but I want to want to quit - if that makes sense?

Can anyone give me some advice on how to even start to want to quit this. I know about Alan Carr, I read the book years ago.

I am going to stay the course and see how far I can go. I think that’s the right mindset for me right now. It’s an approach much like I take with my drinking - I will not drink with you today. I will not smoke with you today. Then tomorrow I’ll wake up and vow the same thing. I can only worry about today.

My cravings are still pretty high, and I've been feeling kinda anxious, sore chest/tightness, achy etc..

Hoping to vent a bit here and see how other people deal with everyday stress after quitting.

I moved with my partner from the UK to Spain in April, and we moved to a new city last month. It's been ridiculously hot all of August and we both have been unwell with different things, so had a shit month. We haven't had a very good opportunity to get to know our city as it's been too hot to go outside, everyone leaves here in August. So we've both had an underlying level of stress, questioning a lot of things, and not enjoying our time here all that much. Recently I started having heart palpitations, which I attributed to vaping alongside smoking (I know..), but I'm still having palpitations 6 days after stopping.. so I'm assuming by now it's mostly stress/anxiety. I've had my heart checked and it seems ok.

Because of everything going on, my stress levels are very high, I feel very anxious and can't sleep well, and I am considering resuming smoking a small number of cigarettes because I don't know if I can deal with this added layer of stress from the withdrawal right now. It's getting a bit too much for me... At the same time, this is the longest I've gone without smoking in over 10 years, and my first attempt at quitting, so I'm sad to let it go to waste and have to go through the same again.

How can I deal with day to day stresses of life after quitting?

Not just because of the carving, but because of the people around me too. A lot of family, friends and colleagues are smoking. 
I'm scared they will offer me some cigarettes (I don't really think that this will happen). 
I'm scared of the evenings with friends when we go out for some drinks. 
I'm scared of my work when my colleagues ask me if I want to go out with them. 
I'm scared what the people around me will say and what they will think when I tell them I want to quit.
And I'm scared of what they will think of me if I fail.

Especially my mom. 
She's a very heavy smoker. She's been smoking for like 40 years now. 
I remember the time we got our first dog. I was in elemantary school and we both wanted one. My dad said we can get one if she stops smoking. We got the dog and a few weeks later I saw her secretly smoking in the basement. 
I watch her going outside alone to smoke after dinner or something and I don't want that for my life. It kinda hurts seeing this. I asked her more than once if she wants to quit with me together, but I think she will never quit.

I'm 26 years old now and smoked for seven and half years. And I want to quit. 
But I don't know if I'm strong enough at this point, I don't know how to handle with the carvings and I don't know how to deal with the people around me. 

And please don't get me wrong. I'm not scared of panic attaks or something like that. I'm just kinda scared.

I read Alan Carr’s Easy Way to start my journey with. 
After reading Alan Carr and during the first few days of struggling I was reading nicotine addiction 101 on whyquit.com. A great suggestion from a fellow redditor. 

Anyway- I have a very ‘visual’ brain. And after reading the info on addiction and how it’s works with the cravings etc, I couldn’t help imagine the nicotine monster Alan refers to as being the monkey from this Add 👆🏻👆🏻 
Giving in to the addiction and craving of the massive nicotine monkey, just starts the next craving for that fix. The only way to break this horrible cycle is to stop feeding the damn monkey.

Due to a very traumatic personal experience I have relapsed and smoked a pack in about a week, coming to a climax when I smoked 5 cigarettes today after being smoke free for 2 months.

I have smoked on and off for about 3-4 years (I’m 21), with 1 1/2 of them being “sober” (is that even a word that applies to smoking cigarettes?). So I know I can do this, I have done it once. I could use any sort of encouragement and kind words, like I said my health anxiety is crazy high and I’m basically convinced that I’ll drop dead from lung cancer any second (this is only a slight exaggeration, haha…), so any reassurance is happily welcomed.

That anxiety sucks so much. I would absolutely blame myself if she ever took up the habit.

Another thing I’ve noticed that instead of having more energy, the last few days I’ve been completely exhausted, which is disappearing because I was looking forward to working out but want to listen to my body and not push myself too much because I know I have a lot of healing to do.

so i started vaping december of 2017 (i was 15) to fit in with my new friend group. they didn't force me in any way, i just really wanted to be accepted by them.

i didn't even like it at first. it made me uncontrollably sweaty and anxious. however, at some point, it escalated to the point where it became an addiction -- and i knew it.

i used juul (of course HAHAH) and these days, it's about 1 pod a day. it's even gotten to the point where if i'm extra stressed, i can go through 2 pods a day.

for reference, 1 pod is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes in the level of nicotine and it takes, on average, 200 puffs to finish a pod.

i want to be healthy. i want my lungs to feel better.

i am lucky enough to be only 19 and not be legally allowed to buy vape stuff, it does help with not buying it when i have a strong urge.

i have gum and it helps so much, but for some reason i get into this cycle of thinking 'i just wanna get withdrawal over with' so i stop chewing the gum and then i get so desperate i start vaping again. it's a vicious cycle.

my dad buys me the vape stuff. horrible, i know, but he has been a food addict for his entire life, and he's almost 50. he can't seem to do it and my mom says that he most likely doesn't think others can get through addiction, since he hasn't been able to.

i know i'm strong enough. i have summoned up so much willpower in many situations in my life so i know i can get through it. i just don't prepare enough.

also, just to be clear, the only person in my life who believes i can do it is my mom. she has been a huge help, but my point of bringing this up is to say that i have no other support for this -- as i said above, my dad is no help and my only friend right now smokes daily. she also doesn't seem to believe i can do it, but she's seen me fail many-a times so it's fair i guess.

i just need help adding more coping mechanisms in my life to help me quit and advice for taking preventative measures for when i do get strong cravings.

Today is the day I'm gonna give up this nefarious habit. I had already tired to stop in the past, but I wasn't really serious about it. This time is different, for many reasons, I joined a local support group run by NHS professionals and attended their first gathering yesterday. Actually, the reason I'm writing this is because they adviced us to keep a diary and share it with other people who are going through the same. I guess it might be useful to find some support outside the group as well, so here we go.


I started smoking when I was 22, mainly because I was depressed and lonely. But the very real reason, I think, was just to piss off my obnoxious, manipulative father who had always used guilt and shame to control me.
I knew I wasn't acting smart, but somehow I felt like I had and **I wanted** to do it. That first ever pack I bought was like a reminder that nothing but me is in charge of my own actions and can decide how to live my own life.  Yeah, it's pretty dumb but somehow it made sense to me. 

But it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. Except... I really like smoking! I like how it makes me feel, the bitter taste of tobacco and the smell it leaves on my fingers when I smoke. It's just not worth it, I know, but still I'm not really incline to conscious decisions when I want something.

Today I trashed the last pack I had, my lighter and ashtray as well. I don't want to risk to fall again for them just because of my impulsive temper.



What did you do to ease the process and motivate you? I see that many people here use apps to track for how long they didn't smoke but I don't think they'll work for me...

I used to have really bad panick attacks, which withdrawals would trigger, and part of me quitting included getting into a better situation (in my case, housed and weeding out toxic people, working on my boundaries, etc) and learning grounding excersizes, self care, cutting down on caffeine, getting support emotionally from friends and other places, and things to manage my anxiety. I believe the fact that I have a lot of trauma and anxiety is what made my old quit attempts so much harder and I've basically learned that it's really important to be kind to myself.

Before March 2020 I'd attempted to quit many times cold turkey.

In March of 2020, when I became housed, someone I live with has breathing problems, so I took care to walk away from the house to smoke, and I tried vape but it was too complex, and then I found vuse ecigs. That worked and it wasn't super cloudy so it wouldn't bother anyone since I was on the opposite end of the house in a room added on later that didn't have vents leading into the house. 

So March 2020, I quit cigs and switched to vuse ecig pods. It was a pretty easy switch, if I'm being honest, and now cigarettes make me sick. The physical benefits were pretty noticable, my breathing cleared up, my stomach issues cleared up. I liked not having a cigarette smell or having to go out of my way to go outside. I liked being able to puff every few minutes instead of smoke a whole cig every 2 hours. Vaping the ecig in bed is nice.

I have attempted to quit cold turkey several times since then and it doesn't work.

So I have introduced nicorette/nic gum partly because it's possible to get it delivered since it's not marketed as a tobacco/nicotine product but as a quitting aid, although if the kids\~ start abusing it it'll probably be unavailable too. (Please don't, people like me really need this stuff. :c)

Fast forward, I'm now using nic gum every couple months. It's a slower process than it was switching from cigarettes because it's not about someone else's health anymore, it's about my own personal mental health, and it's basically me becoming slowly more calm and steady in my day to day life. I do feel that way more often, but one major thing is now holding me back and that's the fact that I work, a lot, and the type of work I do is mentally exhausting and takes a lot of cognitive energy. 

So now I'm working on finding less taxing work I can do to cover my basic needs, and so far that is starting to work out very slowly. And I'm cycling between pods and gum every couple of months. 

The gums works at keeping the hard withdrawals at bay, but it doesn't help when I really, really need to concentrate hard and softening that edge isn't enough.

I expect to quit completely by next March, but I'm not pressuring myself. I am at a point where I'm just tired of nicotine. I mentally don't want it anymore, just my body does. So I expect when the mental load is off, I'll be fine to move to gum full time, and then eventually cycle between nic gum and regular gum. So far, at this stage, regular gum actually helps a lot with the fidgety, oral urge. It's not near as strong as it used to be.

So, to wrap up. 

March 2020 - traded cigs for vuse alto ecig

April/Mayish 2021 - started using nic gum sometimes 

March 2022 - loose goal for quitting 

Overall, it's been a combination of changing my life, basically doing a lot of self therapy, and paving a path where it's possible for me to quit. 

I think it's interesting that in trying to quit nic I've had to really take all this other stuff into account and that as I work on my life and myself emotionally, I'm also working on quitting long term.

It's also nice to be able to call myself a former smoker and to say that I quit cigarettes, after so many failed attempts.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127148,public,self,"My quitting journey so far, since March 2020 (long)",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pjzkca/my_quitting_journey_so_far_since_march_2020_long/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like I'd always smoke around friends, coworkers, etc. But when I was around family members or dates that would find it to be a dealbreaker, I was a ""non-smoker"". 

Any time I was near family, I either waited to smoke and sometimes I would stress about being eager to leave them so I could have a cigarette. Sure I was legally old enough to smoke but my Dad would have threw a giant fit considering my grandma (his mom) and uncle (his brother) both died from lung cancer and emphysema at 55 and 58. My grandma died right in front of him before I was born so I never got to meet her. And my uncle died as my Dad was heading down to visit him. When my uncle died in 2012, I was not a smoker and that should have been my sign to never start again, except I did and smoked for about 7-8 years until I finally quit. 

There were times I'd sneak out to have a cigarette only to get paranoid about smelling like it and being caught when my family was in town. That's the insanity of addiction. There were other times I would go on a date with someone who had in their profile ""non-smoker"", ""no smokers/cigs"", or ""don't go out with me if you smoke cigarettes"". I just wouldn't smoke around them or make sure I didn't smell like cigarettes before the date. That was an added stress in itself. Even times when I'd go to the dentist, the dentist could tell I smoked due to stains on my teeth. So it goes to show that smoking does all sorts of damage than just lungs. 

Anyways, once I quit, it took a huge weight off my shoulders in many different ways, but a big one being that I don't gotta worry about hiding it anymore as I don't do it.

I had been smoking since the age of 16, going to smoke 23-25 cigarettes per day. It was part of my identity, or at least that is what I thought and I didn't want to quit strong enough. I was active regardless that, no drugs, frequent exercise and a vegetarian so I felt overall healthy. Except I wasn't.

For a completely different reason (not seemingly lung related) I was advised to have a chest CT and there it was. Emphysema at the age of 29. COPD, the disease I though only 'oLd PeOplE' had. My doctor told me plain and simple 'either you quit now and take care of yourself or you walk around with an o2 tank by the age of 50'.   


I woke up and quit immediately. And now I hate myself less for ruining my body and making unrepairable but I am doing my best and being asymptomatic most frequently. I also hate smokers in public spaces! I used to be them and it's just karma biting me in the ass, sitting and having people smoking in my face!

It has been a year and all I want to say is thank you to this community for your support. To others who inspired me to just keep going and never look back. I wanted to share this small personal victory here and maybe help one or two people who have doubts or fears.

My mother and one uncle are both smokers, they are both depressed and unsuccessful in life ( my mother doesn’t work and my uncle works has a really bad situation).

They are both a little bit fat and never exercise

My other uncle and aunt, who both don’t smoke, are quite successful in life.

Uncle is business owner and started investing in real estate

My aunt has a master degree and a job she likes, good situation, living in Paris and visiting many countries during the year.

My big struggle is now that I’ve pulled myself from this vice and its influence, I can more easily see what I have allowed myself to do because of it. My partner doesn’t smoke, but they do vape a very high nicotine content vape fluid at a very rapid rate. Adjusting for the nicotine content, it’s well over a pack a day if it were cigarettes. I bought them their first pack of actual cigarettes. I was the one who changed their mind from “those are gross” to “I think I might have one of those as well” and I did the same to our best friend in high school, a friend who is still very important to me and it hurts to see how heavily that friend chain smokes.

Last Friday, I had a party and smoked a disgusting amount of cigs (happens when I drink unfortunately). I woke up the next day with a sore throat and on Sunday, my whole mouth + throat were hurting and it felt like an overall infection. So I’ve been resting and I did have a few cigs (2 yesterday), but I want to quit because I feel so disgusted by this mouth situation and would really love to become 30 as a non-smoker. I would also like to have a first child in the near future, so all signs are here that I should just quit already. I want too and will (havent smoked today yet), but I was wondering if there are any other success stories of people who abruptly quit? For example, I didn’t really have a “last cig” moment or anything, my package is still here, et cetera. Should I first do that today and then quit or just go along with not smoking and try this way?

Today I vow to completely let go of you. 

When I was stressed, you calmed my emotions … so i thought … when I was tired, you woke me up … so I thought … when I was sad, you eased the pain … so I thought. 

What you really did was cause emotional and spiritual harm to my life. You distracted my thoughts, my reality, my goals, and my motivation. You took me out of the moment every single time I hit you. You brought disomfort when it was warm outside. You gave me a negative self image due to the thousands of times I’ve told myself, “I need to quit”. When I was watching a movie, you took me out of the moment, barely allowing me to finish. When I was working, you hurt my ability to be the best of the best. When I wanted to love someone, you drowned my emotions, not allowing me to display my love fully. You hurt me worse than any ex girlfriend ever has. You have distracted me to the point of no return. 

Now, I let go of you, and you are gone like the wind, out of my life. I only held onto you for 3 months, but it was a severely toxic relationship. They say to be aware of your relationships, and nicotine, you are the worst of the worst. You are blocked from my life. You are not allowed to call, text, or ring me anymore. I will not be answering. 

It will take me about 3 days to get over the tiredness without you, just like any other relationship.

I used to smoke from age 17-21.

I switched to vaping and wound up using the nicotine salts (lurkers looking to quit: don't make the mistake of using the salts.)

I got covid-19 for the second time and got pneumonia. That's what it took to make me care about my lungs..

So far I've gone 1 week without vaping. I'm using nicotine gum right now and I just ordered affordable nicotine patches. My state govs anti smoking site said it could be helpful to use that and gum.

Withdrawal is kicking my butt right now. Real bad. I'm determined to stay with it, but I really could use some encouragement and some advice.

Basically all of my coworkers smoked and I got offers all the time. I didn't do it until I just thought fuck it, I'll try it once. That was a mistake as I ended up enjoying the headrush and starting bumming off them. Then I bought packs myself and you know the drill.

Earlier this year, I quit after smoking on and off the previous year as the pandemic made me think about my lungs and how it was a waste of money when I was getting my Covid cash from the government. I felt happy and I started feeling way more better after I quit.

A couple days ago, I was offered a cigarette by my friend and I thought I may as well just take one as I haven't been addicted to them in ages. As soon as I felt that puff come in, I felt sick to my stomach. To the point where I felt like I was going to vomit. I gave it back to friend and told him to finish it. 

Looking back at it now, I am happy that I am not addicted anymore and the fact that smoking makes me sick now instead of happy. My question is did this ever happen you?

Couldn't get past a day. The main reason was that after a few hours my brain was practically screaming at me that I would fail and that what was the whole point of quitting anyway.

I'm surrounded by cigarette butts, my room and clothes smell like a pub, my teeth are about 2 shades yellower, on rare occasions I can taste my breath and it makes me gag, my whole family hates it, I hate the taste, I'm developing a smokers cough in my 20's and I can't buy menthols anymore. I hate it yet my brain still loves the death sticks. 

So I've bought nicotine patches. The only time I've had moderate success with quitting was when I used nicotine gum over lockdown. It was hell but I got to 4 months and relapsed almost immediately when public spaces were open again. So nicotine patches. I did it then and I can do it now. 

My triggers are coffee, my bedroom, my phone, my computer, social interaction, stress and boredom (so not many 🙄). The plan is, stay out of the bedroom. Lock all apps except ones I need for work and study. I'll give myself one hour with everything unlocked which I'm going to devote to sobbing to strangers online. I bought a fresh pack of chamomile and I'm going to make chamomile ice tea to sip throughout the day. I'm peeling a few nectarines so I can have something to chew when I get cravings (the segments not the peel). I've got a few deep breathing exercises for when I feel like I'm going to stab someone.

It felt like the only thing that would keep me calm was smoking. I smoked 1 pack a day, and then covid hit  for 2 years smoked 2 packs a day, as I worked from home and was an idiot. I was noticing the last 6 months a slight dry cough form, and I it was getting harder to breath. Thus, My body was telling me, it's time to stop this crap.

I quit cold turkey 2.5 weeks ago, and right away, I was able to breath better, and was not coughing up a single flem ball, I felt like a new man. Then, the 2ed week, I feel out of breath, and i'm coughing more, without visible flem, but I can taste it sometimes. Also, my throat now hurts when I swallow, I got more eye floaters,, my sinuses are going nuts, as well as my anxiety. I can't tell if I feel out of breath due to anxiety or if i'm really out of breath and just forgot how to breath since I smoked so much (chained smoked a lot). I would not lie to say I'm scared of copd, which I just learned of (everyone talks about cancer, but not many warnings on this fellow). When I go on walks, I don't run out of breath, I can run up stairs just fine, everything a normal person can do, and feel fine, but when i'm sitting still or doing things with low activity I feel out of breath... Which is opposite of what i'm reading. (i've legit been noticing every breath for days now)

Anyway, my wife thinks i'm going nuts due to the anxiety quitting as caused me, and says to wait a year (I smoked and my lungs need to do all they can to clean up) and increase my activity and i'll be just fine. However, the thoughts of copd and it becoming harder to breathe after I quit have me shaking every night. I don't even want tested at the moment, because I was a smoker just 2.5 weeks ago, filled with flem, and know that my lungs are repairing, so if I wait I'd score better...

I'm proud I quit, but not Im just riddled with health anxiety, having a hard time working, can't focus, and just so screwed up.  I thought id quit, and id feel better, but I feel 10 times worse and my mind is making me think I have copd, which I know is not an instant death sentence when treated correctly at my age, though scary. 

&amp;#x200B;

As you all can tell... My anxiety is a monster at the moment.

I thought I was done with them for good. Every once in a blue moon the idea of one would pop up but it was never strong enough to make me buy any. 

Last week my girlfriend had a conversation and it seems she is questioning the relationship. Romantic rejection is my Achilles heal and the only thing I could think of to numb the emotional pain was a cigarette. 

I’m probably up to 8-10 a day. I keep thinking I’m done then I crave another. I’m an avid cyclist, something I really got into after I quit the last time. I can average 19-20 miles an hour and it makes me feel great. Today I went for a ride for the first time this week and rode hard but it was much more of a struggle to keep my normal pace. 

I don’t want to fall back into this again. The comfort that comes from smoking seems to be the only thing that keeps the emotional pain bearable. I had thoughts of running my car off the road after our conversation, and I figure smoking is way better than that, but I feel like it’s a slow form of self harm. 

The relationship is not over, things may be okay, but the stress is killing me. If my girlfriend finds out I started smoking that could very likely end it. 

On the other hand, if the relationship ends,I’m worried I’m going to just stop caring and am going to turn into a heavy smoker just to get by. 

No one knows I’ve started, and I want to stop before anyone finds outs 

If things end, I have no desire to date again for a while. I feel like this will be the only thing to distract me. 

Looking for words of encouragement.

I used Allen Carr, but went about it a different way. 

I had previously read Allen Carr's easy way to quit smoking, and while the logic made sense to me, I found that I would quickly be back smoking again in situations where I still felt that romantic connection to cigarettes (with certain friends, after work, having some beers), which would then quickly lead me back to smoking all the time. Then i tried something else....

I started Vaping, obviously thinking that it is the lesser of two evils. However, as many would know I found vaping actually increased my nicotine intake due to the ease of which you can do it at work, inside etc etc. After vaping for several months flat out, I was starting to get mouth ulcers and not feel great generally. I realised something needed to change... So I again turned to Allen Carr. However, this time I got the audiobook of Allen Carrs easy way to quit Vaping.

Since starting vaping, I had broken the social addiction to smoking, for example at bars, with friends, on lunch breaks at work, I would vape instead of smoke, and, without realising it had been several weeks since my last cigarette. This was important as it allowed me to see my addiction for what it was, a pure nicotine addiction. Previous attempts to quit, I had convinced myself that it wasn't smoking I was addicted too, it was the social aspect of ""goin' out for a dart"" where your troubles would melt away and the conversation would get more deep and enlightening. However without even realising it I had been easily able to break this habit by simply using a different form of nicotine, which quickly broke that illusion for me.

This little change made the Allen Carr method work perfectly, because it was suddenly so clear to me that it was actually just nicotine i was addicted too (which has no real physical withdrawal symptoms after a few days) rather than smoking cigarettes. 

Combined with the fact that I believe vaping to be incredibly lame (and if you're a grown adult who thinks the rest of the adults watching you do it don't think you look like a try-hard teenager you are very mistaken).

It made the concept of quitting actually exciting, because that ""theres's nothing you're giving up"" line finally made sense. 

Anyway I am now 45ish days completely nicotine free, have had more energy, saved so much money, regained the circulation in my hands and feet and generally have so much more self esteem.

It may be counter productive to say start another type of nicotine to quit smoking, but if you are like me and its the social aspect holding you back, it may work for you!",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,127096,public,self,45 days free,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pimvap/45_days_free/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will be quitting smoking tonight. Its already 11:30 here and I intend on smoking my last before the clock strikes 12. I have been trying very hard to quit for quite some time now. Many times a week I will break down and commit to quitting smoking, only to give up the next day.

I am writing this post hoping that it helps me keep myself accountable.

I know smoking is bad for me. I used to workout quit regularly but ever since I increased my consumption from half a pack to 2 packs a day, I am barely able to do anything. I spend so much time in smoking that I can't focus on my work at all. I used to be a start performer, now I am sub average at best. In a firm as competitive as mine, this means a one way ticket to being promoted to customer. On top of fucking up my health and career I am also fucking up my mental health as well.

I am now two weeks into my life as a non-smoker, and it's fantastic. I made my introductory post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/) and my [one week update here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pdwrih/one_week_update/).  


Last Sunday when I wrote my one week update, the week had flown by and been extremely easy. I was stoked at how well I'd quit smoking and didn't have a worry in the world that I'd ever go back. This week was slightly different.   


Certainly it is still true that I won't be smoking again, but this week there were a few times in the evening where it just seemed like it was something I was supposed to be doing. I went and sat outside in my chair out of habit. I was aware that I wouldn't be smoking but I am still not used to the idea that I don't have to stand up out of my chair every 45-60 minutes. There was one instance where I was contemplating getting my car keys and driving to the gas station, but I reminded myself that I didn't want to be a smoker again, and within two minutes, that settled. No big deal, but I showed signs of a crack there.  


On Friday, I went to a buddy's place for a bbq and a lot of beer. He was smoking constantly as he does, and me? Well, not only did I not have a cigarette, ask for one, or ask for a drag, I didn't even want one. It was completely out of the question! I was not only capable of sitting there drinking without having one, but I now know that I can be in its presence and not be shaken. It was wonderful. I can completely trust myself to never smoke again it seems.   


The worst was when my buddy forgot to get more smokes when he got the steaks. He had to go make a separate trip for more smokes after getting the food. It reminded my of that feeling -- that panic about not having enough. I didn't envy that in the slightest. I am so glad to be done that. And I still have no doubts that my last cigarette ever was 2 weeks ago at 9pm.  


As mentioned in my update, I have saved my smoking money and put it into an index fund. I am now actively calling that my Ferrari fund. It's at just over $220 now (in two weeks), and should be enough to get me a Ferrari in 10-15 years (It might be a used one, or I'll wait longer). That's gonna be a cool present to myself for quitting.   


Looking at the smoke free app, all the health improvements are listed, and noticeable. My teeth are whiter, breathing has improved a lot, and energy is way up. In last week's post, I mentioned that my energy was through the roof to the point that I had to add runs and walks to my general workouts. That is still true, but either I'm more used to it, or it's stabilized -- there's no way to be sure of which, but I'm happy with it. It's a huge life improvement.   


The most shocking number on that app to me isn't my 3 days of life regained just by not smoking for 14 days. Nor is it that I'd have smoked 333 cigarettes in that amount of time, it's the *time spent not smoking* number. **How the hell would I have spent 28 hours smoking?!** The calculation makes sense at five minutes per smoke, but holy smokes is that a waste of time/life. Over an entire day out of my two weeks was used on smoking. And that isn't adjusted for sleeping time or anything, that's just 28 hours gone. So in the *life regained* section, it really should include that. Smoking isn't life, it's an annoying curse that subtly takes over every aspect of your day. And takes full days from you very quickly.  


So all this being said, I am two weeks smoke free and I am yet to find a single downside. Cigarettes do nothing but kill. I went from smoking 25-30 per day to zero with ease and I really hope more and more people make this decision. I want everyone to experience life as a non-smoker. If I can do it, even for two weeks, so can you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be doing another update next Sunday when I am smoke free for three weeks. I think I'm going to keep these posts coming for at least three months.

I started smoking even though I have severe asthma about a year and a half ago, because almost everyone does it here. Even though I knew how it was, I didn't want to be left out. Almost twelve years of not smoking went down the drain.

After smoking half a pack daily for around a month and a half, I had to use my asthma can around 3 times a day, and once a night. I knew I will give up smoking for good when october starts, because I have to go back to college, and I want to lose weight/spend less money/fuck bitches. But something bad happened two nights ago, which made me realise time doesn't forgive or understand you.

I was in the bed, chillin at 4 am, having a wank. Suddenly, I had to cough. I knew I had to get up, find my can to get air. But I coughed so hard and I felt like I had so little air, I started to feel dizzy and I started to panic. I was alone, no one at home, and I felt like even thinking was making me consume air. I calmed myself down, went to open a window to get some fresh air, and thought about what happened. I felt trapped in an open cage. I got angry with myself, like how stupid are you, man? You have health problems and tons of other stuff, you want to experience a lot of things, and this is how you want to go down? You want to get killed my SMOKING? Crush those cigarettes, and don't even think about smoking another one. That's what I did.

Yesterday, almost late at night, I thought about smoking a cig. Firstly, I said no. ABSOLUTELY NO. By time, I was like yeah man, one to see how it is. Why I didn't go to the shop was distance, as the shop near me closed.

I just learned about the existence of this subreddit and decided to join as it seems like it would be a lot of support!  


I'm proud to say that I haven't smoked in 2 weeks today! (from 1 pack everyday).  
Well, that's not entirely true...I had half a cigarette when I was buzzed with alcohol but to my surprise, I hated it and couldn't finish. It made me really nauseous and the taste made me actually want to throw up, so I take that I a good sign for my redemption.  


I feel like I'm at the peak of withdrawal side effects, with extreme anxiety that led me to the ER yesterday. It was a panic attack (chest pains, extreme dizzinness, could barely stand up and couldn't controll my breathing), all tests came back normal and the doctors explained to me that it can be a side effect for people who stopped smoking recently...and that it can last up to 2 months.  


So it's not fun, but it's reassuring.  


  
On the plus side, I have been feeling better. I'm not doing much exercise, but I can already see how (apart from the anxiety episodes) I am able to control my breathing better, I am no longer grasping for air after a simple walk around the bock. And, not the end goal, but I'm saving money...every plus is good to take \^\^.

This sub already motivated me to stop smoking few months ago but sadly I got back into ( a night out with friends after long time not seeing them and I didn’t even try to resist ).

I also used to smoke cannabis every night for 3 months, but I stopped for a week now.

I’d like to stop cigarette too, I know it’s going to make me feel better but I’m wondering if it’s a good choice to do it now.


I’m currently in the tough situation:

My girlfriend started school in a city 4 hours away from my hometown, and I decided to go with her.

We currently don’t have accommodation so we’re living in Airbnb week after week. 

This situation is extremely stressful because I have to handle everything about accomodation ( my girlfriend is a foreigner and doesn’t talk my language which is French ), I have to handle work, and I have to handle her: she is really sensitive and cause me lots of stress.

I really felt bad the past 10 days ( since we moved to her school city for finding a room ). I almost thought about going back to my hometown and leave her. But I’m kind of responsible for her.



I know that I would feel way better if I stopped smoking, more energy and less anxiety but I’m worried that I would freak out during the time I’m trying to stop.

Money is tighter than ever and I'm having trouble getting it under control. 

Been crying a lot, trying to process the violence and heartache. It's making me smoke more when I want to smoke less.

Ive quit before, but since my stress levels are so high quiting now feels insurmountable. Addiction has its grip on me. I couldn't get through 1/2 a day of the patch without ripping it off to start smoking again.

I just completed The Easy Way and quitting still feels too hard right now.

Any suggestions (besides therapy)? Tricks and tips? Supplements? I'm afraid that withdrawal symptoms are going to make it even harder to cope. I really need to get my life back on track, these is some of the hardest times I've ever faced.

I write it mostly to figure out plan of actions that will help me to deal with boredom while quiting. Read at your own risk.  
Everyone who tries to quit smoking has two enemies. First one is stress. Second one is boredome. Right now I can manage stress quite easily because i'm on vacation. But I'm not vacationing in Hawaii or Disneyland. I sit at home. It means that second enemy(boredom) gets stronger and stronger everyday. Like Sauron, he is gathering an army and one day he will unleash all its crushing power on me. So, what should I do?  
I have made a list of allies who will help me when the moment of the final battle comes. Things that will help me to cope with boredom. Here they are:  
1. Writing everyday about my experience of quiting smoking. I keeps the brain in good shape and grants support of the community, which is very helpful.  
2. Running. I don't like sports, but this is war, nicht wa? Nobody cares about my preferences. I must run at least 5 minutes per day(yeah, it's not much) to keep myself in a good mood.  
3. I'm a fan of animals. So to entertain myself I can also read and translate articles about lizards, octopuses squids and other cool creature.  
4. And finally cubes. I have a dream to have a pet. To have a rat, if you want me to be more specific. Everyone know that rats are fans of mazes. So I can make few mazes. It's not hard after all. I can use paper and glue to make some small cubes, than connect them with more glue or duct tape or whatever.

I never refuse a robe, you see, not only is it at the height of bad manners, but it is also a great disservice to the self. But let’s stay on track. Remember that business I told you about wrestling my nicotine-addicted brain in the senseless darkness of a tank? Well, I’ll tell you all about it if you’re interested. Have a seat, please.

Well, it was a flop! Mainly. I’ll explain. All was quite enjoyable at first. You enter and check in with a young lady speaking to you in polite hushed tones…

She asked if I’ve ever done this before. I responded with a firm no. We made our way through the cavernous place—evocative of Antelope Canyon—in search of my designated room. It’ll serve to know that I was cranky, for I was missing my nicotine and because I stupidly made my appointment for 8 AM. We found the room at last. A shower was to the right and before me, a large, white, sci-fi-like pod lit with blue LED strips. The lady continued speaking but I didn’t pay attention (remember my crankiness). She finally left and I got right to business. I stripped took a shower, sat in the pod, closed the lid above me, and lied down as if ready for my cryogenesis.

Surprised by how effortlessly I was floating, I relaxed. Vaguely, I recalled the lady mentioning something like a ton of salt being responsible for the density of the water. And of course, I would go onto splash a bit of it in my eye. I climbed out of the thing—naked and blinded and vulnerable—in search of the towel. I spent a good fifteen minutes stuck with the searing pain. As I cried and regained my vision I noticed they had provided me with earplugs. The lady too had mentioned them, but again, I hadn’t listened, it was all coming back to be with a massive delay. So, I plugged my ears, which had already become like a pair of slide whistles, and gave it another shot. This time I was fully ready to face my addiction in the great void of conciseness.

Of course, I would just go on to fall asleep. Nothing truly life-changing happened in the pod. I didn’t face any flaming-haired, white-torsoed, orange-butted demon, as I expected. But—Yes, there is a but—it was after being awoken by the gentle Siri-like voice coming through the underwater speaker and the subsequent reignition of the LED lights that something happened. I got into my robe. And just a few minutes before you came in, I had an epiphany. I know, a man like me doesn’t seem like the type to get epiphanies. But I did! Perhaps it was due to the robe, and its empowering freedom.

I realized that my whole difficulty with quitting nicotine had to do with Grief. I truly was grieving.

And I was grieving at 1RPM. Yes, I mean Revolutions Per Minute. Let’s walk.

Alright, I know you know where this is going, but bear with me. I agree it’s a bit of a tired cliché to bring up the stages of Grief. But I must summon them in order to explain the aforementioned epiphany. They go like this: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Right?

I went straight to google, here in my robe, and found a reassuring quantity of articles equating grief and the quitting of smoking. I mean, it’s not hard to believe they might be very closely related. After all, the brain doesn’t have an extensive cocktail menu. Insofar as we can tell, on the feel-good menu we have only but two cocktails, dopamine and oxytocin. Nevertheless, I was relieved to some extent to find that perhaps it wasn’t all a fault of my character. That I could put some of the burden on this theory of grief.

What I failed to find, however, was someone reassuring me that it was normal to find myself in a revolving state of grief. Does Elisabeth Kübler-Ross mention this in her book? Have you read it? Can you educate me?

Back to the 1RPM business. Remember they go like this: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Well, I go through all five stages by the minute in no particular order. Right this second, as we speak, I’m bargaining What if I just smoke one cigarette a day? How bad could that be? Maybe, just on Sundays? Now, I’ve jumped over to anger. I’m furious that I even had that thought, to begin with. I should know better than that! Now I’m depressed because I shouldn’t be this weak!

You see? Does this happen to you?

Let’s sit down.

Let’s breathe in this clean air. *Fmmm… Ahhh!* I think the sensory deprivation tank really did me some good.

I scorned myself for romanticizing and speaking of smoking’s beauty the other day, but it is now clear that I was getting at something. If those of us who are quitting truly are, in some sense, grieving, I suppose we ought to treat it much like the departure of a loved one. We often hear the platitude “Go through the process” yet since we are already indulging in clichés let us admit it into practice. Let’s go through the process. Let’s look back on our smoking days with love. Let us remember fondly those times we enjoyed a cigarette with a friend or, more enticingly, with ourselves. When the weather was just right and we swam into that blue smoke that would beautify a sunrise or texturize a night sky. Let us accept our love for the cigarette. Yet let us accept that it is over. It must end. Ahead, new things await us. Such is the game.

*Fmmm… Ahhh!*

I realize this might be the last time we meet. There might be nothing to say about the matter, it could just be a cycle of the same stuff.

As I mentioned the other day, I have a visit to the beach and the gym on schedule. I will be going there now. Maybe we’ll run into one another sometime. But for now, I think that what we’ve left to do is just trudge. Trudge forward one step, one revolution per minute. I cannot thank you enough for coming to visit these three days. I wish you the very best, my friend. May call you that? Yes? Oh, that relieves me a great deal. My friend. Remember the 3D model version of myself? Who knows, perhaps next time we run into each other I’ll have become him. Goodbyes are always though—us addicts are really bad at them, eh? Anyways, I’ll be keeping in mind this thing about grief so that it doesn’t catch me by surprise when it hits again in a minute.

*Fmmm… Ahhh!*

It’s hitting me now, in fact. Okay, I won’t make you stay any longer. This is it. A good, proper, formal….

It's my 4th day after 17 yrs of chainsmoking.. Minimum 2 packs a day to a point where I was carrying cartons in my luggage if I was travelling... 

Tried to quit multiple times but failed. Patch, pineapple, e ciggs, hookah nothing works on me. Now it's the toughest time in my life where I lost my mum to covid 3 months back, dad has medical complications which need attention asap, my business is in ruins, I have a huge debt on my head, I have an axial tear in my left knee which is pending and a 7-year-old toothache had finally revisited twice last month. 

I was forced into avoiding smoking for 5 days after a complicated dental surgery with a fear that it will complicate my toothache for a lifetime. I was eagerly waiting for the 5th-day but now I am hoping I can kick this habit once and for all.

Yesterday was mum's bday, baked a cake for the 1st time but had to throw it due to a foolish mistake. Later I found out that dad had made a very critical mistake in his life savings (investment). The anger, stress, and anxiousness really kicked up the urge to smoke. I am trying not to cave in but now I find myself awake in the middle of the night going through Reddit and asking everyone to place a bet on me.

I found a post on the Book of Faces where they were looking for people to participate in a Phase 3 B study for cytisine.  Cytisine triggers the receptors in the brain that nicotine does. I signed up and completed 12 weeks of the double blind study.   IT WORKED. My quit date was one week after starting the medicine.  The first thing I noticed while I was smoking and taking cytisine was that I didn't want to finish my ciggie. 

What is it? It is from a tree root. It is over the counter in most of Europe and Canada. In Canada it is called CRAVV.  The first week was hard, but I made it through with little cravings. Here is how I did it. 

1. Treated myself as if I was sick. After I finished work, I ate and went to bed. Slept a lot. 
2. Drank A LOT of water. Water, water, water. Want a ciggie? Drink some water. 
3. Chewed a lot of gum. 
4. Acknowledged that I was addicted to smoking. It wasn't a nasty habit. It was a dyed in the wool addiction and needed to be treated as such. Quit. No going back. Talk to your support system when you are weak, but acknowledge it is an addiction. 

The side effects were mild. Heartburn that was easily treated with Tums or Prilosec.  Insomnia which I treated with over the counter Unisom.  Aside from that, nothing. No crazy dreams. No stomach upset.  No change in mood. 

Here is the kicker. I smoked every day for FORTY YEARS! I did not think the trial would work, but I was desperate to try anything.  I had tried (and failed) in the past. I tried with Chantix but the side effects were too hard. This time it just feels different. I can honestly say I have gone a day without craving a cigarette. 

So, hopefully cytisine will be approved by the FDA for OTC use in the US. The Canadian price point puts it cheaper than a pack of cigarettes. My test group was 12 weeks of taking cytisine 3mg/3x day. 

If you are in Canada or can have a Canadian friend send you CRAVV, DO IT!!  

Good luck and may the Force be with you to all the people out there on this journey. I know it is hard, but you can do it!

Hey, how y'all doing? I'm 11 months smoke free, one more month to join the ""long-term"" quitters club I think?

I've had weird physical and psychological symtomps all these months, I still have some of them, I still crave ciggartes too, you know what's also happening?

I can't stop thinking about how godly a ciggarette felt after a plentiful meal, in a cold and rainy day, after sex, the very first ciggarette you smoke after you wake up and after you arrive in some place and settle down.

Alas, I felt ""the best"" during all these occasions, but here's the catch folks, when I wasn't smoking and I wasn't feeling ""the best"" , I simply felt ""the worst"" 

I fucking hated when I wasn't smoking, I hated when I HAD to wait until I can light one up, I wasn't really alive unless I had a burning stick inbetween my fingers.

Now, I simply feel ""good"" , when I'm not feeling ""good"" , I only feel ""bad"" 

it's more balanced, more dull, more grounded, no crazy bursts of dopamine and happiness, no crazy moments of wanting to kill everyone else in my sight, I still have many questions I seek answers for, for example am I doomed to not feel ""the best"" again in my life? was life meant to be lived this way? I don't know, and I will in some day.

So in general (and by that I mean always) I am a very strong, independent and positive person.

And by 7pm I’m crying alone in silence so my husband doesn’t hear for absolutely no reason at all. I feel exactly the way I did when I had those 2 days of baby blues. I do not know where this is coming from. For an hour or so I am SO unbelievably sad with a feeling of being alone/abandoned and scared that the tears (and snot) just run down my face. 

I feel ridiculous. I know crying is normal and some people do it more than others (no judging that’s all good) but this is SO out of character for me that I’m quite freaked out.

I'd like to give you this romanticized story of why I quit (maybe for another post) but for right now there are two topics I'd like to discuss. 

1. I am a runner, hiker, walker. I have been sonfor the last 5 years or so. Even at the height of my smoking. Before that, I worked in the restaurant business so I've never been shy about standing on my feet. 

In the past year and some change, my leg will be hard to walk on, stiff, and sometimes painful when I smoked. I quit in April and in July took a trip to celebrate. I couldn't believe how much longer I was able to walk and run over my vacation. I relapsed 3 weeks ago when I transitioned back into work and now I have made it through a week of quitting. My leg has no pain what so ever and I don't do the bouncy leg thing anymore. 

2. I have had only two ear infections in my life. One after I quit in April and this week after quitting again. This one was much more painful and I think the ear pain alone will keep from relapsing ever again. In fact, I can say with almost complete certainty that I'm done relapsing and I have QUIT. Everything else be damned. 

3. I gifted myself a Garmin watch for exercise last Christmas so I constantly measure heart rate, sleep, calories, etc. The number one thing I noticed after I relapsed this LAST time, was sleep. I would sleep 6 or 7 hours but it would show that I only received like 3 hours worth of good sleep. Smoking cigarettes before bed had totally messed up my rest. This past week of quitting, I have slept sometimes 11 hours of the day. 

I realize that sleep differences are probably pretty common but I've never spoken to anyone who has experienced the leg or the ear thing.

We are separate for 2 months and I quit after reading the book “the easy way” by Allen Car

Most of the times I don’t feel the need to smoke, and I was in one week vacation with a lot of views and didn’t even smoke 1 !!

I have stopped smoking several times before. I am on day 6 again. Cold Turkey as I always do.

I was thinking about all the previous times I started smoking again and it is always the same pattern.

I quit smoking. Somehow I find it fairly easy. I know the cravings only last a couple of minutes so I white-knuckled them. On the first few days I have a craving every hour or so by the 2nd week is once a day or every other day. So I know I just need to keep going until I realize I am not thinking about smoking anymore.

So I get cocky. It's normally on a night out when I am drinking with friends after being smoke free for a while. I think to myself... Oh, I've not smoked for X amount of weeks/months, let me have one drag here, it will be fine, I am not addicted anymore.

Famous last words.

I do not know what happens to me. Maybe I will just have one cigarette on that night out but it's like if I woke a little craving monster inside me. So it's pretty much guaranteed that I will begin to reason how if I just bought a package it wouldn't be so bad as I can always stop again and all that crap. And one of the lies that I tell myself is ""nobody will know"". Because I feel deeply ashamed of my stop/start relationship with tobacco. And I will buy some cigarettes and I will smoke again.

So I know that I cannot smoke. I just need to make the decision not to smoke ever again. Day 6 eventually will become Month 6 and hopefully Year 6.

On the third day I was completely run out of willpower and started to smoke again. My second attempt to quit was very much the same. But on the third time something changed.  
Yeah, it still wasn't easy, but I was noticing that it was going so much better then my previous 2 attempts. I was able to enjoy reading and conversations with friends. I didn't want to pity myself, instead I took walks and was doing some joyful things. What was the reason it was so much easier for me? Well, I don't know for sure, but I have some ideas.  
Previously I thought that quiting smoking it's all about health and money. And to be honest I didn't care much about health but I had problems with money. So I felt like quiting smoking it's not really my decision but rather something I must do because of external circumstances. My attitude was like: I like smoking, but if I don't quit I will be punished. So the process of quiting was a lot like punishment to me.  
But then something happened. I was kind of depressed. And kind of bored. Pndemic, you know. I was sitting at home most of the time. And I was chainsmoking one cigarette after other. One after other. One after other. I mean really, every 15 minutes or so. Well, maybe every 20 minutes, but still. I realisied I'm really sick of this shit. And then I read some books about smoking. And I realisied something. Previously(what a naive fool) I really thought cigarettes are harmfull for health but they make your mood better and increase concentration. I thought health and money is a price I pay to feel better. And I was quite ok with that price. But how surprised I was the moment I found out cigarettes make your mood worse and dicrease your concentration. So... what's a point? Maybe that's why third time it was much easier for me to not smoke. My attitude changed. I was no longer thinking: smoking is great, but if I continue smoking I will be punished. I was thinking: smoking is just pointless and ridiculous.   
You know, English is not my native language so it's not easy for me to write in it. When I was a smoker it was so hard for me to concentrate while writing in English. I needed to take breaks and smoke every 5-10 minutes, because I believed without this shit I can't write a word. And now look, I wrote it all in one go.

Smoked half of it and it wasn't even enjoyable, didn't even calm me or give me what I thought it would. Put it out half way. Still though, from a pack a day to zero for a month isn't bad. I don't feel like I threw all that away or anything. I won't be buying any. In a way I'm glad I did so I don't have to pine after them. Now I know for certain; cigarettes suck. 

This almost reminds me of how I quit for 10 years before this. I was so frustrated that I smoked a pack as quickly as I could and got incredibly sick. Intense nausea and a panic attack. I just laid there thinking I was going to die. For 10 years after that I didn't have the slightest craving at all. Even around my friends who would smoke. Even if I was out drinking. Every time I want a cigarette I'm going to look back at today and remind myself that they're shit.

i know i should stop smoking for myself and i really want to, but it’s hard (duh). he’s a major factor in me quitting so i guess that’s a good thing. i am doing it for myself, whatever.

i bought the nicoderm patches and i was doing great, and then i just caved after some personal stress.

throw some words of wisdom please. or a joke. 

are there AA-type groups for stopping smoking? not only am i powerless against alcohol but also even worse around cigarettes. i don’t drink every day but i can’t remember the last time i went without smoking unless i was deathly ill.

Eh? What do you think? You smell that? Fresh, mountain air! My skin’s looking better, no? Step in, let me show you around. What’s that? Oh, that fence-and-tarp covering that dusty area over there? Never mind that. Let me give you a fresh tour of the place.

To start at the top, my nappy hair has undergone some slight improvement already, although, that might be due to my increased ingestion of liquids. A new habit: Oral fixation by way of a variety of zero-cal sparkling waters.

My skin—did I already mention that? I didn’t?—Okay, well if you haven’t noticed it’s looking a little better after just three days, can you believe it? It’s a new landscape on my face, new roofing now without my pores having to act like chimneys to the chemical factory I had running in my mouth and throat.

Which takes me to my teeth and gums. They feel significantly less septic, which has improved my self-esteem a great deal. The kernel-like teeth are still sporting their bronzing, but now that that journey is less futile I might be more motivated to get on the whitening caravan (*Ick, I’ll become one of them, you know the type I’m talking about*). Going lower, the noticeable improvements extend to a wellness in the throat, something that’s easy to take for granted. I remember how much I felt the need to cough and spit just a few days ago.

Recall the length of the nicotine flush I mentioned? While I looked at that I found some other facts of the home-improvement type (not necessarily smoking-related): Skin cells are replaced every thirty-nine days; Red blood cells are replaced every one-hundred and twenty days; And the entire skeleton is replaced every ten years. Crazy, no? A sign that we can really, truly cleanse ourselves from the abuse of chemicals down to the very core of our beings, literally. Together, one day we can be the proud owners of an all-new, non-smoking, clean energy, eco-friendly, TSA approved body!

(Oh, the lungs, you wonder, apparently it takes them up to nine months to repair. That’s quick if you ask me. But don’t quote me on any of this, I just googled things with a delirious need for validation. Google images at that too—a graphic—I couldn’t even bother reading a proper article)

I could keep going with my graphic-borrowed stats—it’s very interesting, actually—but as soothing and sobering as my visible improvements and scientific facts can be, they can only do so much in the irrational mind of a smoker. Stats are nice but have they ever really affected us? Have we ever really cared? We’ve known them all along! I can prove to you how irrational I am by admitting that I genuinely think smoking is a beautiful thing. I have to accept it. Rehabilitation is all about being honest, no? Or maybe it is that life is beautiful and cigarettes just give that fact an additional emphasis. Smoking can be an enhancement of a sunset, a walk in the night, a morning coffee. Isn’t it? It is. Please don’t shame me. *Alright, shame me, I deserve it.* 

It is often brought up that these feelings come from being brainwashed by Hollywood and what lingers from the days when cigarettes were advertised favorably. But I would argue that the sensuality of the cigarette came *before* the advert. Let’s not mistake things here. The beauty is intrinsic, for not even science—humanity’s most beautiful practice before singing and smoking and storytelling—has been able to turn us off to it. Cigarettes are beautiful…but…much in the same way, maybe, that a mushroom cloud can be beautiful; or a snotty, smoggy, phlegmy, apocalyptic LA sunset can be beautiful; or solar flares; or a tragic life.

Forgive me for talking about the beauty of smoking again. Am I repeating myself? It doesn’t escape me that I might sound like some nihilistic teenager but I promise you the sentiment is more mature than that! Will you take me on that promise? I’ve not a good track record have I? Well I’m changing that now, aren’t I? I’m *sorry* I’m not in as good a shape as I expected!

Forgive me for yelling at you, you’re the last person to deserve it. As you can see I’m still dealing with a bit of irritability as part of the withdrawal process. This comes along with spells of attention deficit and a displacement feeling that I can only compare to that of when you hop off of the treadmill after a good-masochistic session with it. You feel the world rolling and moving without you, enjoying itself without you. That’s how I feel. Left behind, unable to appreciate the world around me without the slim companion limping on my lip.

The truth is, with all my attempted optimism, (which I know it might not be much), in the brain, the nicotine telephone still rings every few minutes. If I hadn’t anything to do I could ignore it more easily. But I’m trying to get on with my day! Shut up, okay?!

It looks beautiful outside. It calls for me.

It was nice, enjoying the sunset without a cigarette. Which says everything about the beauty of nature but nothing about the sweet company of a cigarette. But I have to carry on.

When am I going to believe that quitting was a good idea? I keep wondering.

*The morals Gernoymous! The morals of it all!*

It’s getting late, thank you for stopping by. I know I said I’d be in better shape, believe me, I was, but things shift by the minute over here. In an instant, a traffic jam. A cursing protester. Sirens. Telephones. Emails. Mail. Money. Bills!

Three days and counting for me. No, actually, 4320 minutes and counting is more like it. Let’s catch up later, I have things to sort out. Thanks for stopping by. Drive home safe. Your presence was almost as enjoyable a cig. Thanks for putting up with me.

You keep looking at that fence-and-tarp? Huh? Alright, whatever let’s walk over there. I’ll show you.

Behind it, I’m building something. A new me. I’m just embarrassed about it. Anyways, yes, a new me. Here, see this picture zip-tied to the fence? It’s a 3D rendered model of what I’ll look like in the future. Look at the set of choppers on me. Look at me, I have healthy 3D modeled children and have promising prospects to get to know my grandchildren too! I’ve also, in this picture of the future me, acquired a new physique since part of my growth has included going to the gym and eating more subtly and therefore healthier. That’s what I think eating healthy is about, subtlety. When will I get my super-human tastebuds back? Do you know? Search it up and let me know. Anyways, back to the 3D rendered version of me, I have radiant, young skin too. I know the 3D artists were too nice to me, but who knows! Don’t laugh at me.

It’ll take some time to get there but I will be completed someday. A man of great habits I’ll become! You don’t believe me? I’m starting this coming week. Look over here, we have a list of our next construction phases for the coming days:

*One: Finally try the Sensory Deprivation Tank and wrestle your nicotine-addicted brain.*

*Three: Go to the beach and get in touch with your non-smoking-child-self*

*Three: Go to the gym and produce some ethically-sourced dopamine you lazy bum!*

Today it's finally been 2 years i have quite smoking.... First attempted after 17years of a heavy/daily (even when hospitalize) consumption...

I'm happy and enjoying the additional time i got. Getting used to go around with less objects. my skins looks amazing... this grey face just left for a peachy glow...  


But i still need to keep myself aware that, this strong addiction, is waiting for me at any moment... I still ( even if it's less and less) leaving "" dangerous"" setting to be sure I wouldn't smoke.    


I know it's still a big weakness, that i can fall back at any moment. I do know that even a puff on a cigarette would lead me to a pack in less then a week.....

2 years ago I went cold turkey.. Cried everyday for 2 weeks and couldn't believe how many action where starting or ending with a smoke. How I could repeat the same action more then 25 time a day... which other actions would I repeat 25 per day for 17 years....

 I wanted to have a special day with my close one's to ""celebrate"" and enjoy this special date for me... While proposing a different activity, the main comment received it's: How come you are still on this, you are a none-smoker now....   


It's so so wrong. I still fully enjoy the smell of warm smoke, cigarette, cigar, weed what ever.... I find my mind fantasy on smoking 1, to enjoy to coffee to congratulate or to come over a frustration, I find my mind creating great excuses to have one....   


All this to say, I am happy I over come all my addictions and manage to have a more or less a healthy life, but mainly I'm grateful I have the capacity to identify when weakness is around the corner. I will keep reminding me that I'm too weak/addicted to ever taste it again...

I've had a few failed attempts in a row so I've cut down pretty significantly this past month. As a result my sense of smell and taste are back, and when I left my apartment I was hit with the full feel and smell of the new spring. It felt amazing....   
By the time I reached the shops though, a couple had just exited and were having a dart break outside. It seemed so nice... I thought then and there I was cracking for sure now.  
But when it came to pay for the groceries, in a split second decision I turned towards the self checkout avoiding the manned/ciggerette kiosk. It felt nuts, it barely felt like I was the one making the movements. Once I paid, I still had to walk past the kiosk to the exit. And I did... but once again, it barely felt like I was in control. It was almost as if (and I know this sounds bizarre) like my cravings were stopping me from buying them. It honestly felt exciting, I was cheering myself on as I walked home.

  
Truth is though, I think every day I've tried to quit this month has been like that.

Because everyone knows that coffee dehydrates. Thus, for every cup of coffee, I drink one or two glasses of water. So I drink, I guess, about 50 drinks per day. It's not a problem until I need to go out. Because when I need to go out I have a lot of water inside of me and I'm afraid that I will piss my pants(yeah, I know how miserable that sounds) if there are no toilets in place where I am going.

I'm making the steps towards quitting (again). I'm having some trouble because smoking is pretty intertwined with my art and writing, so it's a challenge to undo those behaviours but I'm working on it.

I quit for 4 years up until about 6 months ago and prior to that smoked almost a full pack a day. I think I only quit because I moved country and everything was new, but I made sure to internalize the positives of being smoke-free.

I think what I miss most about not smoking is breathing properly. I walk a lot and it's often through a very steep wood. Despite doing this daily for months and (now)being relatively fit, it's still much more taxing than it should be. That sucks. 

I'm also pretty paranoid about my mortality generally. I have things I want to accomplish and it sucks to think that I'm actively contributing to that ending prematurely. I have a fortunate/unfortunate reference point in my grandparents, in that respect. They're both lifelong smokers that are pushing 90 and haven't had any cancer scares or anything like that, so it's hard to silence the part of my brain that tells me that I'll be fine too. I know it's just a lottery and the risk is not worth it, but you know how it is.

Anyway, I bought some patches. I got the low dose even though I smoke about 8 a day atm. I've been supplementing that with the occasional cheeky smoke with the end-goal of cutting them out entirely as I work on changing my behaviours. So far so good. I found that the medium dose made me feel really nauseous and unable to work, but the low dose seems to be doing the trick so far.

I've found that mindset is important. I'm pretty pessimistic as a person. My smoking is very much tied to the notion that ""life is short and pointless so why try"" kinda thing.

I've been listening and honestly find it a bit dated, but some of the arguments are good. My main reason is for health. I've been using a vape recently, but still smoking as well, and I think that's been causing even more problems. I've been having palpitations, and just feeling very nervous, and I'm pretty tired of not feeling 100%.

The last couple of days I've smoked 1 or 2 cigarettes, but I have a history of anxiety, and I've always used smoking to help with that.  But the thought of quitting, and going without cigarettes makes me so anxious, it's hard to focus on work, and I feel very jittery.

One thing I'm also worried about at the moment is that there won't be anything as satisfying as a cigarette when I am smoke free. I want to get over that fear of emptiness which quitting puts in my head.

Watch your step. Under here. Yes. Excuse the mess, the place is undergoing heavy construction.

Today is my first day nicotine-free in five years. I stopped yesterday morning when I was made aware by my patient and loving wife that my breath was out of the ordinary. The euphemism used was alarming to me even more so than if she had flat out told me that it ""stank"". I had before experienced odd dry throat spells, followed by odd fumes coming from back there after prolonged vaping sessions. But the tone of voice my wife employed...it got to me.

In absolute embarrassment, I threw the trendy new Flum away. I should tell you that it's not my first time quitting, or stopping momentarily for oral health reasons (which are the first to arise) and here I am again craving it as I switch from writing to video editing and back with a bad case of attention deficit. I’m chewing gum, sipping on sparkling tonic to keep my body busy, but, oh, how I miss nicotine, presently in it in its most embracing and beautiful form, a cigarette.

A good way to go about it is by not buying them. I admit, if I had a squashed pack at the bottom of any backpack in my surmounting closet I would go for it. But I know for a fact there are no spare packs lying around anywhere. It was made sure of when I scrambled through everything I owned where I could find even a fractured ciggie last I tried quitting. I am good at repairing them, by the way, at healing them, rehabilitating them. You know, perhaps that jacket…hold on…Nothing. Forget it!

Another thing that helps is reminding yourself of the benefits. I believe this is common practice in the therapies of quitting, but I have no experience with professionals on this sort of thing. I just know what I know, and I can’t help but think I’d be further embarrassed if I had to seek paid advice for such a thing as *this*. Come on! I know, I’m not trying to shame anyone that is aided the professional help—they are braver and less sluggish than I—but I have standards for myself that I don’t have for others. So, I refuse. I can, indeed, do this on my own--maybe. I know many that have done it and with fewer struggles than this.

I am mad. Mad. I type with clasped middle and index fingers, craving for the hold. Then follows reminding myself of the more notorious consequence of smoking. That famous Great Evil. Cancer. However, if you are someone like me or have ever met someone like me, you would know that we treat our relationship with the Great Evil with distant acknowledgment. And for that, we are sort of immune to this mode of fear-mongering and for a long time. Practically since we began. The old “It happens to others, but not to me.” sort of thing is a common trait in the immunity.

How unfashionable it has become to smoke, hasn’t it? Amongst the degrading no-smoking signs, teenage vaping, and marijuana’s acceptance, it’s become reproachable, even. It’s a good thing. It helps us all. But at the same time, for someone like me that hasn’t ever really cared to obtain other people’s approval, it kind of provokes me further.

Alright, tuck in your shirt, Geronymous, this is bordering on the immoral. It’s alright to have disregard for one's own health, but it is plainly insulting and nasty to willingly walk on the road toward Cancerlandia when cleaner souls are forced and packed into the bullet train there. *Get a grip, man!*

Okay, that helped. The moral angle for all of this helps. It hasn’t quite yet done it for the quit-eating-meat thing (I am giving a shot to pescetarianism) but that’s a subject for another day. As you can see the gears in me are operating erratically. My system is asking for that chemical that commandeers the factory within. *Dope the workers that keep me going!* Their angry, the workers in me. Protesting, they are wondering why they are forced into labor without the usual spurts of dopamine. I hope they don’t start any fires.

They’ve started a fire. They want me to walk over to the nearest store now! There are three convenient places around. (“Very convenient stores” I call them.) I'm reminded of when that American term truly sunk in, when I dragged myself to one searching for the comfort of that rectangular box in my pant pocket. Delivery is also an option--that's even more convenient than convenience--I’ve got all the apps for that. Name one, I have it—address and credit card en queue.

I stepped onto my balcony to breathe air for a moment. I know you are disappointed in me, coming that close to caving in. Of what use will the balcony have now? Will I renew my lease here? I’m overpaying for this great view of Los Angeles for what? To look at without the lovely company of the blue smoke at my fingertips? There are a lot of decisions to be made now with all these changes. Turns out cigarettes were deciding on where I lived.

*This is a coup! This is a coup!* What now? Oh boy. The factory workers come marching, wondering what’s going on. Wondering why the commander’s chair is empty. While you've been here, I’ve researched the nicotine gum, the patches, the mints. It all sounds very unappetizing, to be honest. If I am quitting, I should go all the way through. Right? Do you agree? Right. But now I sit without a commander-in-chief. Who will lead now?

Now comes the wagering. Realistically, how likely is it that another year of smoking will cause serious harm to my body? *Remind yourself of the benefits again!*

You must forgive me if I am all over the place. My mind is undergoing heavy maintenance, as you can see. Watch your step! I ask that you forgive me. Perhaps you should drop by another time. I promise to be in better shape. Thank you for dropping by and listening. You were very kind to me, it’d truly hurt me to disappoint you. I promise, until next time, I’ll be good. I’ll behave.

I (23M) have decided to quit smoking again. I tried once before a month ago but failed in a couple of days. I feel ready to quit now.
My biggest problem with quitting smoking is that soon after quitting smoking I say to myself what’s the point? How about I smoke today and quit tomorrow? But as you might has guessed, that tomorrow never comes.

I have been wanting to quit smoking since my smoking has increased from half a pack a day to well over two packs over the past year. This is affecting my work, I used to be a top performer but I can barely get anything done now, I am either smoking, thinking about smoking or feeling too tired because of smoking. I have not had any win in a long time as well. Quitting smoking could just be the win I need. It can also be a way to show myself that I love myself.

After a few weeks of cravings and general aggravation, I began suffering from one of the worst depressive episodes I have ever experienced. To be quite honest I had very little interest in being alive for the first three to five months. I know this sounds like an overreaction. But the reality is that my dependence on this drug went much deeper than I had previously thought. It turns out that I had been self medicating since my very first puffs seven years ago. With this drug in my system I no longer had to face the anxieties of everyday life without a helping hand, and boy did I *squeeze* that hand when I needed it. 

I wanted to share my experience with you because it will probably not be as easy as they said it would be. Your lows may be lower, and it will likely take longer before the cravings pass. In fact, for me the ""cravings"" went very quickly. But what lingered was a general lack of enthusiasm for life, a pit in my stomach as a looked towards the future, and a childish frustration towards the world around me. I found that it is the subtlety of it all that will get to you.

However, today I feel gratitude. Thankful that I made it through the long days, the dark nights. I gave myself a gift by quitting. The gift of a more consistent life. I may now treat those around me with more love and respect than I ever could when life was always on a ticking clock, eagerly awaiting my next puff so I could just buy myself *a little more time*. I now experience a more consistent outlook, more frequently than ever am I content. Life will never be perfect, but at least now I am not punishing myself for a ten minute buzz and a false breath of fresh air.

I used a vape to finally kick the smoking habit and it worked like a charm (picked up a caliburn G for $30 online). 6mg free base juice wasn't enough so I had to switch to 18mg salt nic. That did the trick and made it rather easy to remove smoking from my mind. While an argument can certainly be made that vaping is less harmful than smoking, it is not a risk free and safe method of nicotine consumption like many think. I was noticing some tightness in my chest and slightly labored breathing so I decided it was time to quit vaping. Boy howdy, even with the patches, this has been difficult, but just a week in and I feel a lot better. It's amazing how much damage that vape was doing to me.

I feel like using the vape to get off cigarettes was the right choice. It made it relatively easy to end the smoking habit and I'm now quitting a habit that I've been doing for less than a year rather than one that has been snowballing for 15. That said, I vaped differently that I smoked. Rather than go out for a few puffs every other hour like smoking, it was more like 2 puffs every 5 minutes. I am almost always in an environment that allows me to vape freely so I was almost always vaping. It just complimented everything I did and I'm finding the habit hard to get over.

The hardest parts are after meals and when I first wake up (which is why I'm typing this wall of rambling as a way to distract my mind). Meals just don't feel complete unless I take a few puffs and chain smoking/vaping has been my morning ritual for as long as I can remember (I honestly can't remember a time when it wasn't this way). I started by using the 21mg patch and 3mg juice 7 days ago. I used the 3mg juice for a day to take the edge off and 0mg juice for a day and a half after that. I've since abstained from any vaping and am just using the 21mg patch. I still have my vape, but if I wanted to use it, I'd have to go to the store to buy a coil. I always sleep with my patch on because it makes my dreams beyond fucked up and i enjoy crazy terrifying dreams a lot. I woke up today and the withdrawals weren't that bad. I decided I'm going to leave yesterday's patch on and am going to try to go the day without putting a new one on. Those bitches are crazy expensive so I'll be thrilled if I never have to use one again. 

What has been the hardest times for you to quit smoking and or vaping? What are some things you've done or thought about that have helped you to stay strong? For me, a huge thing is that I find smoking and vaping to be pathetic and immature. I respect how strong of an addiction it is and that many of us started when we were young and stupid, but I still find the entire thing to be childish/embarrassing and self loathing has always been a strong motivator for me. That and I lived with a grandparent that has copd and emphysema and a friend of mine has really bad throat cancer. She's a lovely person, but being around her is a unpleasant reminder of what's awaiting me if I don't get my shit together. To add to the whole me being embarrassed of this habit thing, being over at a friend's seeing my friends smoke as this poor woman is violently blowing snot through the hole in her throat just adds to the whole cringe factor of this stupid decision. I'm impressed that you actually read this whole thing. It helped me to get over the need to be vaping right now. Sorry there wasn't really a point to this post. I just needed to vent and occupy my mind as I woke up. I'm gonna go make some oatmeal with peanut butter, maple syrup, apple chunks, and raisins.

I quit again and got a puppy, who turned out to have a serious health issue and needed a surgery, so naturally I handled stress with smoking. She got better, I quit.

I used to do that myself till I kicked the habit for good. But when you're an addict, all it does is bring your addiction to a new level. 

For example, I started quitting last year in April when I saw friends share articles about smoking putting you at higher risk for covid. I started to smoke only while drinking, and only with friends that smoked. I did good for the most part and would never smoke at home and made sure to never buy packs (a very helpful method), but if I was drinking with smokers, eventually the cravings would kick in and I found myself smoking a few times a month until I had my last one in December. 

What made me realize I was going on the wrong path was a night of heavy drinking in November and I was bumming smokes off multiple people (which I can tell was annoying some people). And it's a slippery slope because you don't wanna buy packs and become a regular smoker again but you also don't wanna be a mooch either. This is why cold turkey is the best method. Not to mention that even if you're only smoking socially, I feel like it makes you look forward to those few cigarettes and you might even tell yourself ""it's ok to do it now, I'm drinking"" and then before you know it, you're addicted again. Even if you don't become a regular smoker again, it's possible to make a habit out of social smoking if you drink regularly.

My addiction to nicotine didn’t start going out of hand until this year when I started smoking those disposable vapes. Those things are evil and got me hooked to nicotine more than cigarettes. They taste great, you can have it anywhere, they don’t make you smell bad, and the nicotine percentage is much higher than regular cigarettes. I was able to go a day or two without a cigarette but it got to the point where I couldn’t even go a couple of hours without hitting the puff bar. I was at my campus for the first time in a few weeks (we had a lockdown due to covid) and it’s a huge trigger spot for me as I would chain smoke there. I went through most of today fine but later on it got really bad and I was doing laps trying to find someone I could get a cigarette off. I didn’t manage to find someone and walking actually helped me feel better. 

I’m mostly writing this to vent and explain how close of a call that was for me to relapse and how proud of myself I am (I don’t really tell myself that enough lol) but I was wondering if after a certain amount of days of not smoking these strong cravings will go away, especially after smoking those puff bars with such a high nicotine percentage pretty consistently.",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,126878,public,self,Almost caved in after 24 hours,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pegxm5/almost_caved_in_after_24_hours/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it is crazy how i never even crave a cigarette. i can stand next to my smoking friends and dont waste a secound on thinking about asking them to get one. i had a cigarette two weeks ago but it tasted disguisting and didnt give me any sort of relieve. also snus is prooven to be dozens of times healthier than smoking so you can take your time to finally quit.

of course it might be different for everyone but for me its like a miracolous healing that i didnt think would be possible so if nothing works for you try switching and dosing down",True,False,False,stopsmoking,t5_2rbuf,126862,public,self,yall underestimate the power of snus,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pe8rlh/yall_underestimate_the_power_of_snus/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So a little background:  
I quit smoking cigarettes last March so, 17 months ago...  

I smoke pot, out of a bong, and I've always mixed my pot with tobacco for the past 14 years now, since I was 15.  
I quit the mix tokes when I quit cigs, but restarted when a family member had passed 5 months later.  
That was 11 months ago now.  
 
So I've been on my e-smoke since I quit cigs, and I'm still on mix tokes.  
  
What's the best way to be able to drop the mix tokes?  
Last time I just smashed my bong cause I don't like spliff joints.  
Should I just try the same?  

I'm definitely addicted to the sensation of a mix toke.  
A bong rip with straight bud makes me cough like a mafuck but, I don't mind joints as that's what my girl smokes when we toke.  
I feel like just getting to the stage of smashing my bong is proving difficult right now...

The tides of my emotions are going and going and I can't reach the bottom of the ocean or the apex of the day. The night will come and I will hope for sleep. Awaking through out the night several times. How did I get here yet again. Time after time I try for my best and I get lost upon the way. Typing seems to help clear my mind and actually let the thoughts out. I don't care if they can hear it. This loud mechanical keyboard. It is all I have for the moment. Moment to moment. I try and I try. But the pain persists. Elevation is felt like the breathe of wind upon a cool fall day. I hope to be blanketed in the warmth of a fire I have yet to lit. I must wait. Waiting is no good. I need it now. That resolve. That resolve of temptation removed from my spinal chord like a surgeon whose on his last chance. Three strikes and your out. No cancer, I hope. No disease or whatever. Hoping will only get me so far. I just have these moments. Five days in and I wonder is this just me or is this just the nicotine. Of course it is the nicotine. Why do I let it get the best of me. Why do I let it all get the best of me. Taking away part of my soul and time here on earth. Taking away from the joy of others as I mope around without any hope. I must push through to the other side that I know exists. I've been there. In a happy place, in fulfillment, with joy. I like this place now. One where I can finally have a conversation of sorts with myself; it is better than the not talking. The dreading of just existence. Nothing brings me pleasure. I am easily agitated. Fuck smoking. Fuck all of it. I will not cave. I will persist through this exist and I will conquer this addiction once more. Let this be heard, let it be forgotten. Let it all go. The suffering is not alone I must remember. Millions before me, millions to come. The problems of the World are much more important than my temporary disdain of living. Thoughts of ending it all rampant the mind from time to time. No action will ever go with this wind. I know because I know there is more to this. More to this than dread or pain. More than the failures of the past. More than the burning desire to become addicted and hooked once more. It is a phantasm, ephemeral, temporal. I can see past its illusions. It has no grasp over me. Sure it weighs down the emotions and level of where I wish to be but wishing gets me nowhere. Sleep is sleepless. Existence just a passing burning sensation of pain. Pain must go. Addiction must go.

Smoking cigarettes. Now I know all the crappyness left is due to cigarettes. 

Why not quit today? Well I am following the Allen carr method and he said to set a quit and I set that quit to tomorrow a couple weeks ago so might as well stick to the plan I guess.

I could smell for what felt like the first time in my life. That dryer vent  5 houses down, glorious! A dead animal on the side of the road long before I actually saw it, glorious! Some one well ahead of me wearing a strong perfume/cologne, glorious. 

Then the financial stuff started pouring in, I finally stopped living paycheck to pay check. I became better financially minded in general when I was able to start seeing that money stack up!  I hit a radical savings goal in the last year thanks to not smoking.  

I felt less impulsive in general,  I started trying to learn new things. And started adopting a life style that I wanted instead of just coping with the one I had previously found myself in. 

Then about 4-5 months ago I decide having a cigarette at the bar while I had been drinking would be fine. I just bummed off of people and had zero desire for one out side of inebriation.  I was in control things were great!

Then a friend of mine got a divorce and started staying out the house. He would smoke at the house, but I had been around plenty of people that smoked and the desire was just not there to, I was in control! We started going out a bit and I continued my habit of bumming while I was drunk, but the more he was at the house and I'd hang with him while he had a smoke the more tempted i became. Fuck it I'm in control! Right? I can totally have one or two with him itll be fine, cause I'm in control! After a few weeks he was ready to go back home and I found myself with out any access to smokes. 

Well I dont smoke any more so this is fine, this is totally fine, I'm fine, I'm in control! But just in case it's not fine, lets go get a cigar from the corner store. We'll just take a little hit every now and then when we really need to. But maybe we need to like, idk preemptively take that hit so it's not so bad when that craving show up. It's ok cause we'll only have a few puff and it's only a cigar a day, I'm in control! I've got this! I dont smoke any more! I quit 7 months ago! Right?

At five cigars a day, and the horrible feeling of my lungs, I decide a pack of smokes might be the better option, the nicotine head aches were killing me from the cigars and everyone knows cigars are way worse for you than cigarettes so I'll go with the ""healthy option."" I can totally manage to ration the cigarettes why better than the cigars. I dont smoke any more, cause you know, I quit 8 months ago!

I've decided to post about going one week. Well, it technically won't be one week until tonight at 9PM, but the probability of me not getting there is 0%, and I won't have time to to an update tomorrow, so now it is.  


I made [this post last Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/p9mbpk/advice_and_encouragement_needed/) and got some great feedback.   


I'd like to specifically thank the people who informed me of the existence of Allen Carr's Easy Way. I have tried to quit smoking so many different times and had no real success. I listened to the audiobook and with a simple change of perspective, quitting this time has been incredibly simple.   


Even in my most successful quit in 2018, I always felt vulnerable to having another smoke, falling back in, wanting a puff of of someone's smoke if I was around it. Now I don't even want one, I didn't even want my last smoke when the book told me to have it. I would legitimately recommend the easy way to anyone who needs to stop smoking. It isn't painful or inconvenient. Cravings are actually enjoyable because it's fun to starve that addiction out. I don't want a cigarette, my addiction does, and if it doesn't get what it wants, it dies. Seriously, cravings are fun and it is almost disappointing how quickly they disappear. Not really of course, because everything else improves so much.  


Some changes I'm noticing:  


Days are long. When you aren't constantly worried about time management or when and where you can get a cigarette in, you have significantly more time to do things. As mentioned in my first post, I am a small business owner and am used to working 12-13 hours per day. Since cutting out smoking, I haven't worked more than 10, and I've been getting more done than before. This is an insane amount of gained efficiency at the cost of absolutely nothing.  


I was worried about the first few days/weeks/months being hell while trying to kick nicotine. It wasn't. It's easy as long as you know that you don't want a smoke. Just stop to smell your fingers every once in a while, it's so much nicer when they don't smell like smoke.

I was not warned about the increase in energy. I'm not sure if this is going to stabilize or taper off in the coming weeks, but it is inconsistent so far. Day one and two were as usual. Day three, I was completely lethargic and actually couldn't get my work done at all. I can't say for sure if that was related to smoking, but it happened. Day four I got up at 4am with a ton of energy and finished the work I'd left from the previous day and easily caught back up. Since then, I have had the highest amount of energy I've had in years. Not in an panicked or twitchy way, but in a wanting to enjoy things kind of way. I've started walking 5 km (3 miles) every evening, on top of my 3x per week workouts just because I want to. And for me that is different because getting any exercise previously involved tremendous discipline.  


Money savings, obviously in a week it isn't that much ($105), but I have taken that amount and put it into a separate investment account. I've always been very into personal finance and good with money (the irony of actually having to build my cigarettes into a budget for the past 11 years), and so I think with this, in 10-15 years I'll be able to buy something just fantastic when I retire. I love the idea of getting a Ferrari with a license plate reading ""Smoke Free"". But we'll see. I'm not concerned about that too much, but I will continue putting away this $105 per week just to track the saved money more than the app, and keep myself disciplined from replacing cigarettes with another expensive habit.  


My house became a lot cleaner. I don't just mean because I have all this extra time to give things a quick wipe and get the dishes put away faster; that's happened too, but the big one is there isn't cigarette mess anymore. No ash on the deck that didn't make it into the ash tray, no puts to deal with, less dirty shoes walking through the house to get to the deck tracking dirt in, etc. I've never really realized what a mess cigarettes made before this. Everything about my surroundings is cleaner. This goes double for the vehicles.  


 I didn't realize how infrequently this would cause me to go inside gas stations. I've come to the conclusion that the only people who physically enter gas stations more than 2x per month are people who only use cash, buy lottery tickets, or cigarettes. And let me tell you, I sure to not miss waiting behind those lottery ticket people.   


I'm trying to think of some other changes I've noticed. My breathing was always fine despite how much I used to smoke so I haven't really noticed an improvement there, at least not a blatant one. Still, I can't imagine my lungs aren't a lot happier.  


Overall, I am yet to find a negative thing about quitting. It's painless and easy if done the right way. I wish I'd been told that years ago. If we're playing the hindsight game, I'd first liked to have never started, and second would have liked to have been turned on to Allen Carr's way. It might not work for everyone, but it sure as hell did for me. I'm thankful to be off of cigarettes at 30 years old.  


One week sounds like premature celebration, but I don't think it is. I don't have any desire to smoke again. Certainty is always scary, but unless there's a gun to my head, the chances of having another puff again are 0. And maybe still even with that scenario.  


I'll probably stop by and write more of these as I keep progressing to keep track of it. It is because of this sub that I am not a smoker. I hope I can help get a few other people there, and a lot further than I am right now by doing so.
