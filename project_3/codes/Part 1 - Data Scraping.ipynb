    "#### Subreddits\n",
    "Reddit is an website consisting of aggregation of forums where people share news, content and discuss any topic of their choosing ([*source*](https://www.digitaltrends.com/web/what-is-reddit/)). Reddit can be further broken down into different communities known as 'subreddits', which starts with 'r/'. For instance, r/boardgames is a subreddit for people to discuss board games, while r/starwars is a subreddit for star wars enthusiast.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addiction\n",
    "Addiction is a condition of being addicted to a particular substance or activity, 2 of the most common forms of addiction is to alcohol and nicotine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcoholism involves problems controlling a person's drinking, which persist even when it affects the person's overall quality of life. Such consumption may lead to tolerance causing the person to consume more to attain the same effect, or experiencing withdrawal symptoms when trying to cut off alcohol ([source](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243), [source](https://www.healthline.com/health/alcoholism/basics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cigarette smoking tends to be correlated to a host of diseases including (but not limited to) cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and even cancer ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm)). Despite this knowledge that a smoker may have, it is hard to quit as cigarettes contain tabacco which often leads to addiction hence making it hard to drop the habit ([source](https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/615/smoking_habitoraddiction)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### r/alcoholicsanonymous and r/stopsmoking\n",
    "Smoking and alcoholism arise as these are the most accesible legal substances available to adults. A common thread we see between these 2 types of addiction is that the difficulty one faces when trying to break the addiction. As such, when a person is looking to quit, they often seek external help, be it seeking professional treatement or a community of like-minded people. The subreddits r/alcoholicsanonymous and r/stopsmoking provide such a community to those seeking it, and with COVID-19 and the acccompanying social restrictions, these online communities provide a feasible alternative to real life meetings and support groups."
